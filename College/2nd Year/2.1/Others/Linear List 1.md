### Classification of Data Structure
Data structure has many different uses in our daily life. There are many different data structures that are used to solve different mathematical and logical problems. By using data structure, one can organize and process a very large amount of data in a relatively short period. Letâ€Ÿs look at different data structures that are used in different situations.

### Classification of Data Structure:

1. **Linear Data Structures:**
   - **Arrays:**
   - **Linked Lists:**
   - **Stacks:**
   - **Queues:**

2. **Non-Linear Data Structures:**
   - **Trees:**
   - **Graphs:**

3. **Homogeneous Data Structures:**
   - **Arrays:**
   - **Vectors:**

4. **Heterogeneous Data Structures:**
   - **Structures:**
   - **Records:**

5. **Static Data Structures:**
   - **Arrays:**
   - **Static Linked Lists:**

6. **Dynamic Data Structures:**
   - **Dynamic Arrays:**
   - **Dynamic Linked Lists:**

7. **Primitive Data Structures:**
   - **Integer:**
   - **Floating-Point:**
   - **Character:**
   - **Boolean:**

8. **Abstract Data Types (ADTs):**
   - **List ADT:**
   - **Stack ADT:**
   - **Queue ADT:**



### Linear Data Structure:

A linear data structure is characterized by the sequential arrangement of data elements, where each element is linked to its previous and next adjacent elements. This structure involves a single level, allowing traversal of all elements in a single run. Implementation is simplified due to the linear arrangement of computer memory. Examples include:

1. **Array:**
   - **Definition:** A static data structure that stores elements of the same type.
   - **Features:**
     - Elements identified by positive indices.
     - Indexing starts from 0.
     - Easier access due to fixed memory size.

2. **[[Stacks]]:**
   - **Definition:** Follows Last In-First Out (LIFO) rule.
   - **Operations:**
     - `Push`: Adds an element to the top.
     - `Pop`: Removes the top element.

3. **[[Queues]]:**
   - **Definition:** Follows First In-First Out (FIFO) rule.
   - **Operations:**
     - `Enqueue`: Inserts an element at the rear.
     - `Dequeue`: Removes an element from the front.
   - **Terms:**
     - Front: Front of the queue.
     - Rear: Rear of the queue.

4. **[[Linked List 1]]:**
   - **Definition:** Stores data in nodes with elements and pointers.
   - **Node Structure:**
     - Element of data.
     - Pointer to the next node in the sequence.
   - **Flexibility:**
     - Stores various data types (strings, numbers, characters).
     - Handles both sorted and unsorted data.
     - Accommodates unique or duplicate elements.

### Static Data Structure:

Static data structures have a fixed memory size and are easier to access. Example:

- **Array:**
  - Fixed memory size.
  - Efficient access.

### Dynamic Data Structure:

Dynamic data structures have a variable size, allowing updates during runtime, enhancing memory efficiency.

- **Examples:**
  - [[Linked List 1]]
  - [[Queues]]
  - [[Stacks]]

These structures adapt to changing needs during program execution.

These classifications aid in understanding how data is organized and accessed in different scenarios, contributing to effective algorithm and program design.

### Difference between Linear and Non-linear Data Structures:

| S. No. | Linear Data Structure | Non-linear Data Structure |
|--------|-----------------------|---------------------------|
| 1.     | Elements arranged linearly, each attached to previous and next. | Elements attached hierarchically. |
| 2.     | Single level involved. | Multiple levels involved. |
| 3.     | Implementation is relatively easy. | Implementation is complex. |
| 4.     | Elements traversed in a single run. | Elements can't be traversed in a single run. |
| 5.     | Memory utilization is less efficient. | Memory is utilized efficiently. |
| 6.     | Examples: array, stack, queue, linked list. | Examples: trees and graphs. |
| 7.     | Applications in application software development. | Applications in Artificial Intelligence and image processing. |
