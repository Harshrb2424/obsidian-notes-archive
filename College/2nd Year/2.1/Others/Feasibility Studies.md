A feasibility study is a critical phase that determines the viability of a proposed system. It aims to answer the fundamental question of whether or not the system is worthwhile. The input to the feasibility study includes preliminary business requirements, an outline description of the system, and its intended support for business processes. The study results in a report providing recommendations on whether to proceed with requirements engineering and system development.

## Purpose of Feasibility Study

The feasibility study addresses three key aspects:
1. **Contribution to Organizational Objectives:**
   - Assess whether the proposed system aligns with and contributes to organizational objectives.

2. **Technological Feasibility:**
   - Evaluate if the system can be engineered using current technology and within budget constraints.

3. **Integration Feasibility:**
   - Determine if the system can be effectively integrated with other existing systems.

## Feasibility Study Implementation

1. **Information Assessment:**
   - Assess the available information, including preliminary requirements and system description.

2. **Information Collection:**
   - Pose critical questions to stakeholders in the organization:
     - What if the system isn't implemented?
     - What are the current process problems?
     - How will the proposed system address these issues?
     - Anticipate integration challenges.
     - Identify technology needs and required skills.
     - Determine facilities supported by the proposed system.

3. **Information Sources:**
   - Consult various sources, including department managers, software engineers, technology experts, and end-users.

4. **Feasibility Study Timeline:**
   - Aim to complete the feasibility study within two to three weeks, gathering comprehensive insights.

## Feasibility Study Report

1. **Recommendations:**
   - Provide a clear recommendation on whether to proceed with system development.

2. **Proposed Changes:**
   - Propose any necessary changes to the system's scope, budget, and schedule.

3. **High-Level Requirements:**
   - Suggest additional high-level requirements for the system based on the feasibility study findings.

The feasibility study is a focused effort to make informed decisions about the system's viability, considering organizational objectives, technological feasibility, and integration requirements. The resulting report guides stakeholders in determining the next steps in the system development process.
