**Types of Operating Systems (Continued):**

 **Parallel Operating System:**
   - **Description:** Parallel systems are designed to enhance program execution speed by dividing programs into multiple fragments and processing them simultaneously.
   - **Advantages:**
     - High performance: Parallel systems execute computationally intensive tasks faster than single-processor systems.
     - Cost-effective: They can be cost-effective as they don't require additional hardware for communication.
   - **Disadvantages:**
     - Limited scalability: The number of processors or cores in a single computer is finite, restricting scalability.
     - Complexity: Programming and debugging parallel systems is more complex compared to single-processor systems.
     - Synchronization overhead: Synchronization between processors can introduce overhead and impact performance.
