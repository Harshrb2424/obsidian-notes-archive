## CPU Utilization
- Goal: Keep the CPU as busy as possible.
- Theoretical range: 0 to 100%, real-time varies from 40 to 90% based on system load.

## Throughput
- Average CPU performance measured by the number of processes completed per unit.
- Output varies based on process length or duration.

## Turnaround Time
- Time taken for a process to complete from arrival to finish.
- Includes time waiting for memory access, in line, CPU use, and I/O.

## Waiting Time
- Affected by scheduling algorithm.
- Time spent waiting in the ready queue, not the time to complete the process.

## Response Time
- Relevant in collaborative systems.
- Time from submission to the first response for an application process.
