In software engineering, the interface specification is crucial, as most systems need to operate seamlessly with other systems. The interfaces through which systems interact must be explicitly defined as part of the requirements. There are three main types of interfaces that may need to be specified:

## 1. Procedural Interfaces

These interfaces involve existing programs or subsystems that provide a set of services accessible through interface procedures. Such interfaces are commonly referred to as **Application Programming Interfaces (APIs)**.

## 2. Data Structures

Interfaces may involve the exchange of data structures between subsystems. Graphical data models are often the most effective notations for describing this type of interface.

## 3. Data Representations

This type of interface specification deals with established data representations for existing subsystems. Formal notations are highly effective in specifying these interfaces.

In summary, a well-defined interface specification is essential for ensuring smooth interactions between different software components or systems. Formal notations and graphical data models play a crucial role in accurately representing procedural interfaces, data structures, and data representations in a standardized and comprehensible manner.
