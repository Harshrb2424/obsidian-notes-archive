### Risk Mitigation, Monitoring, and Management

An effective software development strategy must include robust risk management practices to address potential issues and ensure project success. This involves three key components:

1. **Risk Avoidance:**
   - Proactively identifying and avoiding risks whenever possible is the ideal strategy for managing software projects.
   
2. **Risk Monitoring:**
   - Continuous monitoring of project activities and potential risks allows for early detection and proactive intervention.
   
3. **Risk Management and Contingency Planning:**
   - Developing strategies to mitigate identified risks and planning for contingencies in case they materialize is essential for project success.

#### Risk Mitigation Strategies:

1. **Reducing Turnover:**
   - Identify causes for turnover through meetings with current staff.
   - Mitigate controllable causes (e.g., poor working conditions, low pay) before project commencement.
   - Develop techniques to ensure continuity when team members leave.
   - Disperse information among project teams to minimize knowledge silos.
   - Define documentation standards and ensure timely development.
   - Conduct peer reviews to ensure multiple team members are familiar with project aspects.
   - Assign backup staff members for critical roles.

#### Risk Monitoring Factors:

1. **General Team Attitude:**
   - Monitor team morale and stress levels in response to project pressures.
   
2. **Team Cohesion:**
   - Evaluate the degree to which the team has come together and formed strong relationships.
   
3. **Interpersonal Relationships:**
   - Assess the quality of relationships among team members and address any conflicts early.
   
4. **Compensation and Benefits:**
   - Monitor potential issues related to compensation and benefits that may affect team motivation.
   
5. **Job Availability:**
   - Keep track of job opportunities within and outside the company that may impact team retention.

#### RMMM Plan:

1. **Inclusion in Project Plan:**
   - The risk management strategy can be incorporated into the software project plan or organized into a separate Risk Mitigation, Monitoring, and Management Plan.
   
2. **Documentation:**
   - The RMMM plan documents all risk analysis activities and serves as a guide for the project manager within the overall project plan.
   
#### Risk Monitoring Objectives:

1. **Assess Risk Occurrence:**
   - Evaluate whether predicted risks are materializing as expected.
   
2. **Ensure Risk Aversion Steps:**
   - Verify that risk mitigation strategies are being properly implemented.
   
3. **Collect Information for Future Analysis:**
   - Gather data from risk monitoring activities to inform future risk analysis and decision-making.
