### Multiple-Processor Scheduling

In a multiprocessor system, where multiple processors share the workload, scheduling becomes a critical aspect of managing resources efficiently. There are different approaches to multiple-processor scheduling, and concerns such as processor affinity and load balancing play crucial roles.

#### Concerns in Multiprocessor Scheduling:

1. **Asymmetric Multiprocessing:**
   - **Description:**
     - In asymmetric multiprocessing, a single processor, known as the master server, handles all scheduling decisions, I/O processing, and system activities.
     - Other processors execute only user code.
     - Simplicity is achieved as only one processor accesses system data structures, reducing the need for extensive data sharing.
   
2. **Symmetric Multiprocessing (SMP):**
   - **Description:**
     - SMP allows each processor to be self-scheduling.
     - Processes may be in a common ready queue or each processor may have its private queue of ready processes.
     - Scheduling involves each processor's scheduler examining the ready queue and selecting a process to execute.
     - Careful programming is required to prevent conflicts when multiple processors access and update common data structures.
     - Virtually all modern operating systems, including Windows, Linux, and macOS, support SMP.

#### Processor Affinity:

Processor affinity aims to keep a process running on the same processor to avoid migration. It takes various forms:

1. **Soft Affinity:**
   - The operating system attempts to keep a process on a single processor.
   - There is a possibility of migration between processors.

2. **Hard Affinity:**
   - Allows a process to specify a subset of processors on which it may run.
   - Main-memory architecture, like non-uniform memory access (NUMA), can influence processor affinity.

#### Load Balancing:

Load balancing ensures an even distribution of the workload across all processors in an SMP system. It is necessary when each processor has its private queue of eligible processes.

1. **Push Migration:**
   - A specific task periodically checks the load on each processor.
   - If an imbalance is detected, it evenly distributes the load by pushing processes from overloaded to idle or less-busy processors.

2. **Pull Migration:**
   - Occurs when an idle processor pulls a waiting task from a busy processor.
   - Push and pull migration are not mutually exclusive and are often implemented in parallel in load-balancing systems.

Efficient scheduling and load balancing are crucial for maximizing the utilization of resources in multiprocessor systems, leading to improved performance and responsiveness.
