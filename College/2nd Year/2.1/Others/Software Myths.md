# SOFTWARE MYTHS

Beliefs about software and the process used to build it can be traced to the earliest days of computing. These myths have several attributes that make them insidious.

## Management Myths

### Myth: We already have a book that‘s full of standards and procedures for building software - Won't that provide my people with everything they need to know?

- **Reality:**
  - The book of standards may exist, but its effectiveness depends on its use and awareness.
  - It needs to reflect modern software engineering practices to be beneficial.

### Myth: If we get behind schedule, we can add more programmers and catch up.

- **Reality:**
  - Software development is not a mechanistic process like manufacturing.
  - Adding more people requires time for education, reducing productive development effort.
  - People can be added, but in a planned and well-coordinated manner.

### Myth: If I decide to outsource the software project to a third party, I can just relax and let that firm build it.

- **Reality:**
  - If an organization lacks internal software project management capabilities, outsourcing can lead to struggles.

## Customer Myths

### Myth: A general statement of objectives is sufficient to begin writing programs - we can fill in the details later.

- **Reality:**
  - Ambiguous objectives are a recipe for disaster.
  - While comprehensive requirements may not always be possible, stability is crucial.

### Myth: Project requirements continually change, but change can be easily accommodated because software is flexible.

- **Reality:**
  - Change impact varies, and it can require additional resources and major design modifications.

## Practitioner’s Myths

### Myth: Once we write the program and get it to work, our jobs are done.

- **Reality:**
  - Effort after the software is delivered is substantial (60-80%).
  - Completion of the working program is just one part of the software configuration.

### Myth: The only deliverable work product for a successful project is the working program.

- **Reality:**
  - A working program is part of a software configuration, which includes documentation for software support.

### Myth: Software engineering will make us create voluminous and unnecessary documentation and will invariably slow us down.

- **Reality:**
  - Software engineering is about creating quality, not just documents.
  - Better quality reduces rework and leads to faster delivery times.
