5. **Time-Sharing Operating Systems:**
   - **Description:** Time-sharing operating systems allocate specific time slices (quantums) to each task, ensuring all tasks run smoothly. Each user gets a share of the CPU's time in these multitasking systems.
   - **Advantages:**
     - Equal opportunities for all tasks.
     - Reduced chances of software duplication.
     - Minimized CPU idle time.
     - Efficient resource sharing, reducing hardware costs.
     - Improved productivity and user experience.
   - **Disadvantages:**
     - Reliability issues.
     - Security and data integrity concerns.
     - Data communication problems.
     - Higher overhead and complexity.
     - Increased security risks.
   - **Examples:**
     - IBM VM/CMS.
     - TSO (Time Sharing Option) by IBM.
     - Windows Terminal Services.
