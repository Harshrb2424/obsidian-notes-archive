The Banker's Algorithm is used to avoid deadlock and allocate resources safely to each process in a computer system. It examines all possible tests or activities in the 'S-State' before deciding whether the allocation should be allowed to each process. Named after its analogy to a banker approving a loan, it helps the operating system share resources among processes successfully.

## Working Principle

- The algorithm checks whether a person should be sanctioned a loan amount to simulate allocation resources safely.
- It manages resources in a way similar to a bank system, ensuring that a person's request for a loan is approved based on available resources.

## Operating System Application

- In an operating system, when a new process is created, it provides information about upcoming processes, resource requests, counts, and delays.
- The operating system uses this information to decide the execution sequence of processes, avoiding deadlock scenarios.

## Banker's Algorithm Requirements

When working with the banker's algorithm, it requires information about three things:

1. **Maximum Request:**
   - How much each process can request for each resource in the system. Denoted by [MAX] request.

2. **Currently Allocated Resources:**
   - How much each process is currently holding each resource in the system. Denoted by [ALLOCATED] resource.

3. **Available Resources:**
   - The number of each resource currently available in the system. Denoted by [AVAILABLE] resource.

## Data Structures

The banker's algorithm uses several data structures:

1. **Available:**
   - An array defining each type of resource available in the system.

2. **Max:**
   - A matrix indicating each process's maximum resource requirements.

3. **Allocation:**
   - A matrix indicating the type of resources currently allocated to each process.

4. **Need:**
   - A matrix representing the number of remaining resources for each process.

5. **Finish:**
   - A vector indicating whether a process has been allocated requested resources and has released them after finishing its task.

The Banker's Algorithm combines the safety algorithm and the resource request algorithm to control processes and avoid deadlock.
