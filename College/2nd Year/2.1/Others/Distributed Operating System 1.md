**Distributed Operating System:**
   - **Description:** Distributed operating systems are a recent advancement in computer technology. Various interconnected computers communicate using a shared communication network. Independent systems have their memory units and CPUs, forming loosely coupled or distributed systems.
   - **Types of Distributed Systems:**
     - **Client/Server Systems:** Clients request resources, and servers provide them. Servers can serve multiple clients simultaneously, and they communicate via a computer network.
     - **Peer-to-Peer Systems:** Nodes in these systems share resources and tasks equally, interacting via a network.
   - **Advantages:**
     - Failure of one system doesn't affect network communication.
     - Enables remote access to files and software from other networked systems.
     - Enhances data exchange speed, computation speed, and scalability.
     - Reduces the load on host computers and minimizes data processing delays.
   - **Disadvantages:**
     - Network failure can disrupt the entire communication.
     - Lack of well-defined languages for establishing distributed systems.
     - High cost and complexity, including the underlying software.
