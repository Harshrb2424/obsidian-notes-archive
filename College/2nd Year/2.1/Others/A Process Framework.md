# A PROCESS FRAMEWORK

A software process must be established for the effective delivery of software engineering technology. The process framework lays the foundation for a complete software process, identifying a small number of framework activities applicable to all software projects, regardless of size or complexity.

## Process Framework Overview

- The process framework encompasses:
  - A set of umbrella activities applicable across the entire software process.
  - Framework activities populated by software engineering actions.
  - Each software engineering action represented by different task sets.

- a process defines "who is doing what, when, and how to reach a certain goal."

# Framework Activities in Software Engineering

## Communication

- **Overview:**
  - Involves heavy communication and collaboration with the customer.
  - Encompasses requirements gathering and other related activities.

## Planning

- **Overview:**
  - Establishes a plan for the software engineering work.
  - Describes:
    - Technical tasks to be conducted.
    - Risks likely to be encountered.
    - Resources required.
    - Work products to be produced.
    - Work schedule.

## Modeling

- **Overview:**
  - Encompasses the creation of models for better understanding of software requirements and design.
  - Composed of two software engineering actions:
    - **Analysis:**
      - Involves a set of work tasks focused on understanding requirements.
    - **Design:**
      - Involves work tasks to create a design model.

## Construction

- **Overview:**
  - Combines core generation and testing.
  - Core generation involves creating the actual code.
  - Testing is required to uncover errors in the code.

## Deployment

- **Overview:**
  - Software is delivered to the customer.
  - Customer evaluates the delivered product.
  - Provides feedback based on the product's evolution.


## Umbrella Activities

A set of umbrella activities plays a crucial role in the software process, providing overarching support:

1. **Software Project Tracking and Control**
   - Assess progress against the project plan and take necessary action to maintain the schedule.

2. **Risk Management**
   - Assess risks that may affect the project outcome or product quality.

3. **Software Quality Assurance**
   - Define and conduct activities to ensure software quality.

4. **Formal Technical Reviews**
   - Assess software engineering work products to uncover and remove errors before propagation.

5. **Measurement**
   - Define and collect process, project, and product measures to assist the team in delivering software that meets customer needs.

6. **Software Configuration Management**
   - Manage the effects of change throughout the software process.

7. **Reusability Management**
   - Define criteria for work product reuse and establish mechanisms to achieve reusable components.

8. **Work Product Preparation and Production**
   - Encompass activities required to create work products such as models, documents, logs, forms, and lists.

## Adaptation of Software Process Models

- Intelligent application recognizes that adaptation is essential for success.
- Fundamental differences exist in various process models, including:
  - The overall flow of activities and tasks and their interdependencies.
  - The degree to which work tasks are defined within each framework activity.
  - The identification and requirement of work products.
  - The application of quality assurance activities.
  - The application of project tracking and control activities.
  - The detailed and rigorous description of the process.
  - Involvement of the customer and other stakeholders.
  - Autonomy given to the software project team.
  - The prescription of team organization and roles.
