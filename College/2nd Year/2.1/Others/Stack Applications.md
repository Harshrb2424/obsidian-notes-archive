### **Applications of Stacks:**

1. **Arithmetic Expression Evaluation and Conversion:**
   - Stacks are used to evaluate and convert arithmetic expressions from infix to postfix notation.

2. **Recursion:**
   - Stacks are essential in recursive function calls to manage function execution and memory.

3. **Parenthesis Checking:**
   - Stacks help in verifying the balanced arrangement of parentheses in mathematical expressions.

4. **String Reversal:**
   - Stacks can reverse a string by pushing its characters onto the stack and then popping them.

5. **Memory Management:**
   - Stacks are used in memory allocation and deallocation, including function call stacks.

6. **Function Call Processing:**
   - Stacks are crucial for tracking and managing function calls in programs.

7. **Infix to Postfix Conversion:**
   - Stacks are used to convert infix expressions to postfix notation for easier evaluation.

8. **Undo and Redo Operations:**
   - Stacks are employed in word processors and other software to implement undo and redo functionality.

9. **Virtual Machines (e.g., JVM):**
   - Stacks are integral to the execution of bytecode in virtual machines, such as the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).

10. **Media Players:**
    - Stacks can be used to manage playlists and play the next and previous songs in media players.

11. **Recursion Management:**
    - Stacks are used in recursive algorithms to manage function call frames.


### **Algorithm to Convert Infix to Postfix:**

1. Start by scanning the infix expression from left to right.

2. If you encounter an operand (a number or variable), add it to the final postfix expression.

3. If you encounter an operator or parenthesis, follow these rules:
   a. If the operator's precedence is greater than the precedence of the operator at the top of the stack, push it onto the stack.
   b. Otherwise, pop operators from the stack with greater or equal precedence and push the scanned operator onto the stack. If you encounter an open parenthesis while popping, stop and push the scanned operator.

4. If you encounter an open parenthesis '(', '[', or '{', push it onto the stack.

5. If you encounter a closing parenthesis ')', ']', or '}', pop operators from the stack and add them to the output until you find the corresponding open parenthesis, which you discard.

6. Continue steps 2-5 until you've scanned the entire infix expression.

7. Print the output, which is the postfix expression.

8. If there are any remaining operators in the stack, pop and add them to the output until the stack is empty.

**Infix to Postfix Conversion:**

1. Infix Expression: 3 + 4 * 5 / 2
2. Start with an empty stack and an empty output string.
3. Scan the expression from left to right.
   - 3 is an operand, so add it to the output.
   - + is an operator, push it onto the stack.
   - 4 is an operand, add it to the output.
   - * is an operator, push it onto the stack.
   - 5 is an operand, add it to the output.
   - / is an operator, check precedence. Pop * and add it to the output. Push / onto the stack.
   - 2 is an operand, add it to the output.
4. Finish scanning, so pop any remaining operators from the stack to the output.
5. Postfix Expression: 3 4 5 * 2 / +

**Evaluating Postfix Expression:**

1. Postfix Expression: 3 4 5 * 2 / +
2. Create an empty stack.
3. Scan the postfix expression from left to right.
   - 3 is an operand, push it onto the stack.
   - 4 is an operand, push it onto the stack.
   - 5 is an operand, push it onto the stack.
   - * is an operator, pop two operands (5 and 4), calculate (4 * 5 = 20), push 20 onto the stack.
   - 2 is an operand, push it onto the stack.
   - / is an operator, pop two operands (2 and 20), calculate (20 / 2 = 10), push 10 onto the stack.
   - + is an operator, pop two operands (10 and 3), calculate (3 + 10 = 13), push 13 onto the stack.
4. The stack now contains the final result: 13.

So, the original infix expression 3 + 4 * 5 / 2 is successfully evaluated to 13 in postfix notation.
