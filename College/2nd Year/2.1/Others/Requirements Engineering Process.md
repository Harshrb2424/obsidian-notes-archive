# Requirements Engineering Processes

The goal of the requirements engineering process is to create and maintain a comprehensive system requirements document. This process encompasses four high-level requirement engineering sub-processes, each addressing different aspects of the requirements:

## 1. Feasibility Study
- **Objective:** Assess whether the system is valuable and beneficial to the business.
- **Activities:** Evaluate the feasibility of implementing the proposed system, considering economic, technical, and operational aspects.

## 2. Elicitation and Analysis
- **Objective:** Discover and understand the requirements of the system.
- **Activities:** Engage stakeholders to gather information, analyze gathered data, and define both functional and non-functional requirements.

## 3. Specification
- **Objective:** Convert requirements into a standardized form for documentation.
- **Activities:** Clearly articulate and document the requirements, often using standardized templates and forms. This involves defining functional and non-functional aspects.

## 4. Validation
- **Objective:** Ensure that the documented requirements accurately reflect the system the customer desires.
- **Activities:** Verify the requirements by checking against the customer's needs and expectations, addressing any discrepancies or ambiguities.

## Requirement Management
- **Objective:** Manage changes in requirements throughout the development process.
- **Activities:** Track, control, and document changes to requirements, ensuring that the evolving system aligns with the changing needs and priorities.

### Alternative Perspective: The Spiral Model
An alternative perspective on the requirements engineering process presents it as a three-stage activity organized in an iterative manner around a spiral. The process involves understanding high-level business and non-functional requirements, eliciting user requirements, and progressing towards detailed system requirements and modeling. The spiral model accommodates varying levels of detail in requirements development, allowing for different iterations.

### Structured Analysis Method
Some view requirements engineering as the application of a structured analysis method, such as object-oriented analysis. This entails analyzing the system, developing graphical system models (e.g., use-case models), and annotating them with additional information on performance or reliability. These models serve as a detailed system specification.
