## Requirements Elicitation and Analysis
The heart of the requirements engineering process is requirements elicitation and analysis, also known as requirements discovery. This phase involves technical staff collaborating with customers to understand the application domain, define the services the system should provide, and identify operational constraints. The participants in this process may include end-users, managers, maintenance engineers, domain experts, and other stakeholders.

## Challenges in Requirements Analysis

1. **Unclear Stakeholder Desires:**
   - Stakeholders may not have a clear understanding of what they truly want from the system.

2. **Diverse Expression of Requirements:**
   - Stakeholders express requirements using their own terms and perspectives.

3. **Conflicting Stakeholder Requirements:**
   - Different stakeholders may have conflicting requirements, leading to challenges in prioritization.

4. **Influence of Organizational and Political Factors:**
   - Organizational and political factors can impact system requirements, adding complexity.

5. **Dynamic Nature of Requirements:**
   - Requirements may change throughout the analysis process due to emerging stakeholders or shifts in the business environment.

## The Requirements Spiral

### Process Activities

1. **Requirements Discovery:**
   - Interact with stakeholders to understand and discover their requirements, including domain requirements.

2. **Requirements Classification and Organization:**
   - Group related requirements and organize them into coherent clusters.

3. **Prioritization and Negotiation:**
   - Prioritize requirements and resolve conflicts through negotiation with stakeholders.

4. **Requirements Documentation:**
   - Document requirements, providing input for the next iteration of the spiral.

### Process Cycle

The requirements engineering cycle initiates with requirements discovery and concludes with requirements documentation. With each cycle, the analyst's comprehension of requirements improves.

### Requirements Classification and Organization

This activity focuses on identifying overlapping requirements from various stakeholders and grouping related requirements. System architecture models are often used to associate requirements with specific subsystems.

### Negotiation and Prioritization

Stakeholders may have diverse perspectives on the importance and priority of requirements, often leading to conflicts. Regular negotiation sessions are essential to reach compromises.

### Requirement Documentation

In the documentation stage, requirements elicited are documented in a way that facilitates further requirements discovery and guides subsequent phases of the development process.
