## Software Engineering Layers

Software engineering is structured as a layered technology, with each layer playing a crucial role in the development process.

1. **Tools**
2. **Methods**
3. **Process**
4. **A Quality Focus**

## Software Engineering is a Layered Technology

Software engineering is built on an organizational commitment to quality, making quality a fundamental focus of the entire process.

### 1. Process Layer

The process layer is the foundation for software engineering. It serves as the glue that holds the technology layers together. The software engineering process is a framework established for the effective delivery of software engineering technology.

### 2. Software Layer

The software layer forms the basis for management control of software projects. It establishes the context in which:

- Technical methods are applied.
- Work products are produced.
- Milestones are established.
- Quality is ensured.
- Change is properly managed.

### 3. Methods Layer

Software engineering methods rely on a set of basic principles governing various areas of technology, including modeling activities. Methods encompass a broad array of tasks, such as:

- Communication.
- Requirements analysis.
- Design modeling.
- Program construction.
- Testing and support.

### 4. Tools Layer

Software engineering tools provide automated or semi-automated support for the process and methods. When these tools are integrated to allow information interchange, it establishes a system for supporting software development known as Computer-Aided Software Engineering (CASE).

The integration of tools ensures that information created by one tool can be seamlessly used by another, enhancing efficiency and collaboration in software development.

Software engineering is structured as a layered technology, and any engineering approach within it must be built upon an organizational commitment to quality. The bedrock supporting software engineering is a focus on quality.

## Layers of Software Engineering

1. **Quality Focus:**
   - The foundational layer emphasizing a commitment to quality as an organizational principle.

2. **Process Layer:**
   - Serves as the foundation for software engineering, acting as the glue that holds the technology layers together.
   - Defines a framework essential for the effective delivery of software engineering technology.
   - Establishes the context in which:
     - Technical methods are applied.
     - Work products are produced.
     - Milestones are established.
     - Quality is ensured.
     - Change is properly managed.

3. **Software Layer:**
   - Forms the basis for management control of software projects.
   - Provides the context for applying technical methods, producing work products, establishing milestones, ensuring quality, and managing change.

4. **Methods Layer:**
   - Relies on a set of basic principles governing various areas of technology, including modeling activities.
   - Encompasses a broad array of tasks, such as:
     - Communication.
     - Requirements analysis.
     - Design modeling.
     - Program construction.
     - Testing and support.

5. **Tools Layer:**
   - Provides automated or semi-automated support for both the process and the methods.
   - Integration of tools enables information created by one tool to be used by another.
   - Establishes a system for supporting software development, known as Computer-Aided Software Engineering (CASE).
