## What is a Computer?
A computer is an electronic device that manipulates information or data. It has the ability to store, retrieve, and process data. Computers can be used for various tasks such as typing documents, sending emails, playing games, browsing the web, editing spreadsheets, creating presentations, and even producing videos.

## Hardware vs. Software
- **Hardware:** Physical components of a computer, including input devices (e.g., keyboard, mouse) and internal parts.
- **Software:** Set of instructions that tells the hardware what to do, examples include web browsers, games, and word processors.

## Block Diagram of a Computer

A block diagram provides a pictorial representation of how a computer works internally. The key components include:
- **Processor Unit (CPU):** The brain of the computer responsible for calculations and control.
  - **Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU):** Performs arithmetic and logic operations.
  - **Control Unit (CU):** Controls overall computer operation, fetches and decodes instructions.
- **Input/Output Unit:** Facilitates communication between the external world and computer memory.
- **Memory Unit:** Stores data for processing; includes primary and secondary storage.
- **Disk Storage Unit:** Stores data permanently for future use.

## Processor Unit (CPU)
The CPU is the heart of the computer, consisting of:
- **Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU):** Performs arithmetic and logic operations.
- **Control Unit (CU):** Controls the entire operation, fetches and decodes instructions.

## Input/Output Unit
This unit handles devices transmitting information between the external world and computer memory.

## Memory Unit
Essential for storing intermediate data and results. Holds instructions to be executed and data for processing.

## Disk Storage Unit
Two types: 
- **Primary Storage Unit:** Directly linked with input and output units, stores input data and calculation results.
- **Secondary Storage Unit:** Stores data permanently for long-term use.

## Computer Architecture vs. Computer Organization

### Computer Architecture
1. Concerned with how hardware components are connected to form a system.
2. Acts as the interface between hardware and software.
3. Helps understand system functionalities.
4. Involves high-level design issues.
5. Deals with logic (instruction sets, addressing modes, data types, cache optimization).

### Computer Organization
1. Concerned with the structure and behavior of a computer system as seen by the user.
2. Deals with the components and connections in a system.
3. Describes how units in the system are arranged and interconnected.
4. Expresses the realization of architecture.
5. Deals with low-level design issues.
6. Involves physical components (circuit design, adders, signals, peripherals).
