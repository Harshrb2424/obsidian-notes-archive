A digital computer is a type of digital system designed to perform various computational tasks. Unlike analog computers, which use continuous signals, digital computers process discrete data represented in the binary number system, consisting of two digits: 0 and 1. The fundamental unit of digital data is called a "bit."

## Historical Perspective

The first electronic digital computer emerged in the late 1940s, primarily serving numerical computation purposes. Since then, digital computers have evolved significantly, becoming ubiquitous in various applications.

## Binary Number System

By convention, digital computers use the binary number system. This system employs bits as the basic units of information, allowing for straightforward electronic implementation. Each bit represents a binary digit, with values of either 0 or 1.

## Functional Entities

A computer system is typically divided into two primary functional entities:

### 1. Hardware

Hardware encompasses all electronic components and electromechanical devices that constitute the physical entity of the computer. It includes components such as processors, memory units, input/output devices, and more.

### 2. Software

Software comprises instructions and data that instruct the computer on how to execute various tasks. It is the intangible counterpart to hardware, allowing users to interact with and manipulate data. Software includes operating systems, applications, and other programs.

## Binary Representation

Digital computers process data using binary representation. This involves encoding information using sequences of 0s and 1s, allowing for efficient storage, manipulation, and transmission of data within the computer system.

# Central Processing Unit (CPU)

The Central Processing Unit (CPU) is a critical component of a computer system, responsible for executing instructions and performing calculations. It consists of:

- **Arithmetic and Logic Unit (ALU):** Manipulates data through arithmetic and logic operations.
- **Registers:** Store data for quick access during processing.
- **Control Circuit:** Fetches and executes instructions, coordinating the overall operation of the CPU.

# Memory Unit

The memory unit in a digital computer stores both instructions and data. It includes:

- **Random Access Memory (RAM):** Enables real-time processing of data, providing fast access for both reading and writing.

# Input-Output Devices

Input-Output devices facilitate user interaction with the computer. Common devices include:

- **Keyboard and Mouse:** Generate inputs from the user.
- **Terminals:** Display information to the user.
- **Magnetic Disk Drives:** Store and retrieve data.
- **Communication Devices:** Enable data exchange with external systems.

# Computer Organization

Computer organization focuses on how hardware components operate and connect to form a functional computer system. It ensures that components function as intended and investigates the organizational structure.

# Computer Design

Computer design involves the hardware design of a computer system. Once specifications are formulated, designers develop the hardware, determining which components to use and how to connect them. This aspect is also referred to as computer implementation.

# Computer Architecture

Computer architecture is concerned with the structure and behavior of the computer as perceived by the user. It encompasses information formats, instruction sets, and memory addressing techniques. Architectural design specifies the functional modules, such as processors and memories, and organizes them into a coherent computer system.

# Addition

For addition:
```
   8  4  2  1
R1= 1  1  0  1  = 13
R2= 1  0  1  0  = 10 
   16  8  4  2  1 
+  1  0  1  1  1  = 23
```
