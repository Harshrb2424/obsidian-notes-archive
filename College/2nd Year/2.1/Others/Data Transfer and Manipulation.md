# Data Transfer Instructions

- Data transfer instructions move data from one place in the computer to another without changing the data content.

- The most common transfers are between memory and processor registers, between processor registers and input or output, and between the processor registers themselves.

- Table 8-5 gives a list of eight data transfer instructions used in many computers.

- The **load** instruction has been used mostly to designate a transfer from memory to a processor register, usually an accumulator.

- The **store** instruction designates a transfer from a processor register into memory.

- The **move** instruction has been used in computers with multiple CPU registers to designate a transfer from one register to another and also between CPU registers and memory or between two memory words.

- The **exchange** instruction swaps information between two registers or a register and a memory word.

- The **input** and **output** instructions transfer data among processor registers and input or output terminals.

- The **push** and **pop** instructions transfer data between processor registers and a memory stack.

- Different computers use different mnemonic symbols to differentiate addressing modes.

- As an example, consider the **load to accumulator** instruction when used with eight different addressing modes.

- Table 8-6 shows the recommended assembly language convention and actual transfer accomplished in each case.

- **ADR** stands for an address.
- **NBA** is a number or operand.
- **X** is an index register.
- **R1** is a processor register.
- **AC** is the accumulator register.
- The `@` character symbolizes indirect addressing.
- The `$` character before an address makes the address relative to the program counter PC.
- The `#` character precedes the operand in an immediate-mode instruction.

- An indexed mode instruction is recognized by a register placed in parentheses after the symbolic address.
- The register mode is symbolized by giving the name of a processor register.
- In the register indirect mode, the name of the register that holds the memory address is enclosed in parentheses.
- The auto-increment mode is distinguished from the register indirect mode by placing a plus after the parenthesized register. The auto-decrement mode would use a minus instead.
# Data Manipulation Instructions

## 1. Arithmetic Instructions

- Data manipulation instructions perform operations on data and provide computational capabilities for the computer.

- The data manipulation instructions in a typical computer are usually divided into three basic types:

### 1.1 Arithmetic Instructions

- The four basic arithmetic operations are addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

- Most computers provide instructions for all four operations.

- Some small computers have only addition and possibly subtraction instructions. Multiplication and division must then be generated by means of software subroutines.

- The increment instruction adds 1 to the value stored in a register or memory word.

- A number with all 1's, when incremented, produces a number with all 0's.

- The decrement instruction subtracts 1 from a value stored in a register or memory word.

- A number with all 0's, when decremented, produces a number with all 1's.

- The add, subtract, multiply, and divide instructions may use different types of data.

- The data type assumed to be in the processor register during the execution of these arithmetic operations is defined by an operation code.

- An arithmetic instruction may specify fixed-point or floating-point data, binary or decimal data, single-precision, or double-precision data.

- Examples of mnemonics for three add instructions that specify different data types are shown below:
  - ADDI: Add two binary integer numbers
  - ADDF: Add two floating-point numbers
  - ADDD: Add two decimal numbers in BCD

- Special instructions like "add carry" and "subtract with borrow" deal with the carry from a previous operation.

- The negate instruction forms the 2's complement number, effectively reversing the sign of an integer when represented in signed-2's complement form.

## 2. Logical and Bit Manipulation Instructions

- Logical instructions perform binary operations on strings of bits stored in registers.

- They are useful for manipulating individual bits or groups that represent binary-coded information.

- Typical logical and bit manipulation instructions include:
  - Clear
  - Complement
  - AND, OR, XOR
  - Bit manipulation operations: clear, set, complement

- Other bit manipulation instructions perform operations on individual bits, such as clearing, setting, or complementing.

## 3. Shift Instructions

- Shifts are operations in which the bits of a word are moved to the left or right.

- Shift instructions may specify logical shifts, arithmetic shifts, or rotate-type operations.

- Types of shift instructions include logical shift left/right, arithmetic shift left/right, rotate left/right, and rotate through carry.

- Shifts may be used for various purposes, including moving bits to designated positions, preserving sign bits in arithmetic shifts, and performing circular shifts.

- A list of typical arithmetic instructions is given in Table 8-7.

- The logical shift inserts 0 into the end bit position.

- Arithmetic shifts usually conform to the rules for signed-2's complement numbers.

- Rotate instructions produce a circular shift, circulating bits shifted out back into the opposite end.

- Rotate through carry treats a carry bit as an extension of the register being rotated.
