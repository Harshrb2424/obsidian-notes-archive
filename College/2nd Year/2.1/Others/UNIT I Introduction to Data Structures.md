# Introduction to Data Structures

#### Need of Data Structure:
The relationship between data structure and algorithm synthesis is crucial for efficient implementation. Data structures facilitate the organization, retrieval, management, and storage of data. Key needs for data structures include:

1. **Easy Modification:**
   - Data structure modification should be straightforward for efficient implementation.

2. **Time Efficiency:**
   - Implementation should require less time for optimal performance.

3. **Memory Space Savings:**
   - Efficient use of storage memory space is essential.

4. **Ease of Representation:**
   - Data representation must be straightforward for both developers and users.

5. **Access to Large Databases:**
   - Easy access to large databases is critical for effective data handling.
