Design engineering encompasses the set of principles, concepts, and practices that lead to the development of a high-quality system or product.

## Design Principles

Design principles establish an overriding philosophy that guides the designer in the work that is performed.

## Design Concepts

Design concepts must be understood before the mechanics of design practice are applied.

## Design Practice

Design practice itself leads to the creation of various representations of the software that serve as a guide for the construction activity that follows.

## What is Design?

Design is what virtually every engineer wants to do. It is the place where creativity rules â€“ customer's requirements, business needs, and technical considerations all come together in the formulation of a product or a system. Design creates a representation or model of the software, but unlike the analysis model, the design model provides detail about software data structures, architecture, interfaces, and components that are necessary to implement the system.

## Why is it Important?

Design allows a software engineer to model the system or product that is to be built. This model can be assessed for quality and improved before code is generated, tests are conducted, and end-users become involved in large numbers. Design is the place where software quality is established.

The goal of design engineering is to produce a model or representation that exhibits firmness, commodity, and delight. To accomplish this, a designer must practice diversification and then convergence. Another goal of software design is to derive an architectural rendering of a system. The rendering serves as a framework from which more detailed design activities are conducted.
