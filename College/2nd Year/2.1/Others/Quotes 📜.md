#### Love is not about how much you say **I Love you** but how much you can prove that it's true.

#### Make your character do good that
- Even in a dark room a women feels safe with you.
- A blind man can see your kindness and a def man can hear your words.
- People praise your parents for your behaviour.
A child or an old aged person smiles at you everytime they see you.


#### Life sometimes gets so hard that you have to forget what you feel and you have to remind yourself of what you deserve
#### If  you keep trying to fix other people, it's you that's broken

#### Hope you learn that true happiness is not the absence of sadness

#### Sometimes we miss the feeling not the person

#### Don't underestimate yourself. You won your first race when you weren't even born. 
You won your first race when you weren't even born, it was decided that universe needs you
#### You were born to fulfill your purpose, To help others and to love the people that needs you
IT was decided that all animals, birds, trees, people need your attention.
#### Don't ever regret your life, God has made you because he loves you

Maintain Mystery And Intrigue: Avoid revealing everything about yourself all at once. Let people be curious and interested in getting to know you over time.  
  
Engage In Playful Teasing: Lightly engage in banter and playful flirting. This creates a dynamic of fun and light-hearted interaction that can be appealing.  
  
Project Confidence: Display self-assuredness and poise. Confidence is attractive, but be mindful not to come across as arrogant.  
  
Utilize Sensory Appeal: Engage the senses in a memorable way. This could involve wearing a distinctive fragrance or having a unique style that leaves a lasting impression.

> I have never beg for anyone to stay, But I said please that day, Whatever it is we can work this out. I have never prayed for anything so badly but I remember begging the universe that if it could hear me somehow all I want is a chance to make it full. It was when I was on a verge of losing you I realized I have never wanted anything more. *I can't.* Was all you said and that was the end of it all. Two words, five letters, I have never been hurt by anything more.

You got to keep the big picture in mind. Most purpose is more burden than glory. And trust me. You never want to be the guy who avoids it
because you can't live with the burden.

Love was not worth risking the friendship we had.

In the world full of, you don't talk, so I won't talk. Find someone why says, if you don't talk, I will talk.

I used to think communication was the key until I realized comperhension is. You can communicate all you want with someone but if they don't understand you, its silent chaos.

> if you cry because the sun has gone out of your life, your tears will prevent you from seeing the starts.

"And when you told me what your favorite book was, I bought it and read it over and over... trying to find prices of you in it."

#### Sometimes you just need is twenty seconds of insane courage, just literally twenty seconds of embarrassing bravery. And I promise you, something great will come of it.

And tonight, I guess, I miss you. But please don't ask me why. I've tried to kill the feeling, but it doesn't want to die. - Lauren Levi

**The greater my wisdom, the greater my grief. To increase knowledge only increases sorrow.**
The wiser you are, the more worries you have; the more you know the more it hurts.

Not a single person has tried to fight for me to stay in their life. I fought for everyone I lost. This is my pain.

POV: You waited whole day just to have a little conversation.

holding that 1% hope.

A focused fool can accomplish more than a distracted genius.

You've learned that *nothing kills you faster than your own mind.* Be calm and don't stress over things that are out of your control.

Man's inability to sit quietly in a room, alone.

When you find no solution to a problem, its probably not a problem to be solved. But a truth to be accepted.

I always wonder why birds stay in the same place when they can fly anywhere on the earth. Then I ask myself the same question.

Learn to love the things you wish most not had happened.

"Hum baney he thy tabaah hone ko. Tera milna to aek behana tha."

**"As long as you've got me. I've got you : )"**

I'm paradoxical. *I like to be happy but I think about sad things all the time. I don't really like myself but I love the person I've become. I say I don't care but I just care too much, deep into my bones. I creave attention yet I reject everything that comes my way. I healed people, but I broke my own heart trying to fix them. I love to listen, but I never tell them what's inside me.*

The most beautiful things in life are not things. They're people, places and memories.

Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. It does not dishonor other. It is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs. Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth. It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres.

Almost dead yesterday, maybe dead tomorrow, but alive, gloriously alive, today.

You owe nothing to your younger self. You are not responsible for being the person you once thought you'd be.

In her mind, he was dead. In his, she was the reason to keep going.

Be honest when trouble comes, be simple when money comes, be humble when you get authority, and be calm when angry, this is called management of life.

**Go first.**
*start.
Say Hello.
Lead the run.
Do the first set.
Make the first call.
Introduce yourself.
Call a friend for no reason.
Help a stranger for no reward.
Find people going up the same mountain.
Climb together.*
A simple truth: *The world rewards those who initiate.*
So, don't wait for opportunities. 
**Create them.**

Pray like all depends on God,
act like all depends on you.
Nothing happens without both.

**Why are you so kind to others?**
Because no one deserves to go through what I went through.

Stay kind after all. keep it on.

That weight you carry on your shoulders will never go away.
you know? are you willing to bear that burden and move on?
Are you willing to know true pain? sacrifice love?
What are you waiting for? For someone to help you?
Are you facing your fears? your traumas? yourself?
Now is the time to do it.

And like the moon, we must go through the phases of emptiness to feel full again. Flowers grow back even then are stepped on, so will you. Be selective with your battle, sometimes peace is better than being right. Your path will me harder, if your callings are great.

*Pasand karna asan hai, pasand karte rehna mushkil hai!!*

*Kisi ko **talab** maar gayi humari, aur koi humko paakar bhi **khush** naa hua.*

And we fall for those who are not even there to hold us.

There are no point to be kind you get nothing in return.
exactly..!!
be kind without expecting it back. be the sunshine for someone and make their day, kindness is the language deaf can hear and blind can see. If you can't find kind people be one...
