## Software Requirements Document
The software requirements document serves as the official statement outlining what is expected from the system developers. It encompasses both the definition of user requirements and a detailed specification of system requirements. It is important to note that this document is not a design document; rather, it primarily focuses on WHAT the system should achieve rather than HOW it should achieve it.

## Users of a Requirements Document

The IEEE requirements standard establishes a generic structure for a requirements document, which must be customized for each specific system. The document typically includes the following sections:

## Structure
### 1. Introduction
- **Purpose of the Requirements Document:** Clearly articulates the goal and objectives of the document.
- **Scope of the Project:** Defines the boundaries and extent of the project.
- **Definitions, Acronyms, and Abbreviations:** Provides a glossary for understanding specific terms used.
- **References:** Lists any external documents or sources referenced in the requirements document.
- **Overview of the Remainder of the Document:** Gives a brief preview of the sections that follow.

### 2. General Description
- **Product Perspective:** Describes how the software product fits into the broader context, including dependencies on other systems.
- **Product Functions:** Enumerates the primary functions and features of the software.
- **User Characteristics:** Details the characteristics of the anticipated users.
- **General Constraints:** Outlines any overarching limitations or constraints.
- **Assumptions and Dependencies:** Specifies any assumptions made during the requirements analysis and identifies external dependencies.

### 3. Specific Requirements
This section comprehensively covers functional, non-functional, and interface requirements. It may include details on external interfaces, system functionality and performance, logical database requirements, design constraints, emergent system properties, and quality characteristics.
