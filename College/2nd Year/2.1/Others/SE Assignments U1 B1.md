# *1. What is legacy software? Explain briefly its impact in software engineering.*

# Legacy Software

Legacy software refers to older programs developed decades ago. The quality of legacy software is poor due to its inextensible design, convoluted code, and inadequate documentation. Test cases and results are often not achieved.

## Evolution of Legacy Systems

As time passes, legacy systems evolve for the following reasons:

- The software must be adapted to meet the needs of new computing environments or technology.
- The software must be enhanced to implement new business requirements.
- The software must be extended to make it interoperable with more modern systems or databases.
- The software must be rearchitected to make it viable within a network environment.

Key characteristics of legacy software include:
1. **Outdated Technology**
2. **Limited Integration**
3. **Lack of Documentation** 
4. **Obsolete Hardware/Software Dependencies** 
5. **Security Risks**
6. **Difficulty in Finding Skilled Resources**
