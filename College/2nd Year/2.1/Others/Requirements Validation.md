Requirements validation is a crucial step in the requirements engineering process, focused on demonstrating that the defined requirements align with the actual needs of the customer. Given the high costs associated with requirements errors, validation becomes paramount. Fixing a requirements error after system delivery can be up to 100 times more expensive than addressing an implementation error.

## Requirements Checking Criteria

1. **Validity:**
   - Does the system provide the functions that best support the customer's needs?

2. **Consistency:**
   - Are there any conflicts or contradictions among the requirements?

3. **Completeness:**
   - Are all functions required by the customer included in the specifications?

4. **Realism:**
   - Can the requirements be feasibly implemented given the available budget and technology?

5. **Verifiability:**
   - Can the requirements be effectively checked and tested?

## Requirements Validation Techniques

### 1. Requirements Reviews

- **Description:**
  - Systematic manual analysis of the requirements.
- **Involvement:**
  - Both client and contractor staff should participate in reviews.
- **Types:**
  - Reviews can be formal (with completed documents) or informal.

### 2. Prototyping

- **Description:**
  - Using an executable model of the system to validate requirements.
- **Coverage:**
  - Detailed coverage in Chapter 17.

### 3. Test-Case Generation

- **Description:**
  - Developing tests for requirements to assess testability.

## Requirements Reviews

- **Timing:**
  - Regular reviews during the formulation of requirements are crucial.
- **Participants:**
  - Involvement of both client and contractor staff.
- **Formality:**
  - Reviews can be formal (with completed documents) or informal.

## Review Checks

1. **Verifiability:**
   - Is the requirement realistically testable?
  
2. **Comprehensibility:**
   - Is the requirement clearly understood by all stakeholders?

3. **Traceability:**
   - Is the origin of the requirement clearly stated and understood?

4. **Adaptability:**
   - Can the requirement be changed without causing significant impacts on other requirements?

Effective communication between developers, customers, and users during reviews is key to resolving problems at an early stage and ensuring a successful requirements validation process.
