# *1.     Explain in detail the following s/w process models with a neat diagram.*
*i) Evolutionary process model
ii) Incremental Process model*
# Evolutionary Process Model

- Software evolves over time.
- Business and product requirements often change during development.
- Straight-line paths to an end product are unrealistic.
- Evolutionary models are iterative and applicable to modern applications.

## Types of Evolutionary Models

1. **Prototyping**
2. **Spiral Model**
3. **Concurrent Development Model**

## Prototyping

- A mock-up or model (throwaway version) of a software product.
- Used when the customer defines objectives but doesn't specify input, output, or processing requirements.
- Suitable when uncertainty exists regarding:
  - Efficiency of an algorithm
  - Adaptability of an operating system
  - Human/machine interaction
![[Pasted image 20231111190536.png]]
### Prototyping Steps

1. Requirement gathering.
2. Identify known requirements.
3. Outline areas requiring further definition.
4. Quick design.
5. Build a prototype.
6. Prototype evaluation by the customer.
7. Refine requirements.
8. Adjust the prototype to satisfy customer needs.

### Limitations of Prototyping

- In the rush to get it working, overall software quality or long-term maintainability may be overlooked.
- Use of inappropriate OS or PL (Programming Language).
- Use of inefficient algorithms.

ii)
# The Incremental Process Model

- Linear sequential model not suitable for iterative projects.
- Incremental model is suited for such projects.
- Used when initial requirements are reasonably well-defined, and there's a compelling need to provide limited functionality quickly.
- Functionality expanded in later releases.
- Software is developed in increments.

## The Incremental Model

1. **Communication**
2. **Planning**
3. **Modeling**
4. **Construction**
5. **Deployment**

![[Pasted image 20231111190634.png]]
- Increments labeled from 1 to N.
- Software releases in increments.
- 1st increment constitutes the Core product with basic requirements.
- Core product undergoes detailed evaluation by the customer.
- Plan developed for the next increment based on customer feedback.
- Process is repeated until the complete product is produced.

# *3.Explain about spiral model and agile model?*
# The Spiral Model

- The Spiral Model is a crucial Software Development Life Cycle model that emphasizes risk handling.
- Diagrammatically represented as a spiral with multiple loops, each loop is a phase in the software development process.
- The number of loops is project-dependent, determined dynamically by the project manager.

## Phases of the Spiral Model

- The Spiral Model is risk-driven and focuses on managing risk through multiple iterations.
- It consists of the following phases:

1. **Identification of Objectives:**
   - Determine the goals and constraints for the specific phase.

2. **Risk Analysis:**
   - Evaluate potential risks and develop strategies to address them.

3. **Engineering:**
   - Develop and test the product as per the identified objectives.

4. **Evaluation:**
   - Review the results and assess project status.

- **Excessive Documentation:** Large number of intermediate stages requires excessive documentation.
`# Agile Process Model

- The meaning of Agile is swift or versatile. "Agile process model" refers to a software development approach based on iterative development.
- Agile methods break tasks into smaller iterations, or parts do not directly involve long-term planning.
- The project scope and requirements are laid down at the beginning of the development process.
- Plans regarding the number of iterations, the duration, and the scope of each iteration are clearly defined in advance.
- Each iteration is considered as a short time "frame" in the Agile process model, which typically lasts from one to four weeks.
- The division of the entire project into smaller parts helps to minimize the project risk and to reduce the overall project delivery time requirements.
- Each iteration involves a team working through a full software development life cycle including planning, requirements analysis, design, coding, and testing before a working product is demonstrated to the client.
![[Pasted image 20231109190203.png]]
## Phases of Agile Model:

1. **Requirements Gathering**
2. **Design the Requirements**
3. **Construction/Iteration**
4. **Testing/Quality Assurance**
5. **Deployment**
6. **Feedback**

### Requirements Gathering:

In this phase, you must define the requirements. You should explain business opportunities and plan the time and effort needed to build the project. Based on this information, you can evaluate technical and economic feasibility.

### Design the Requirements:

When you have identified the project, work with stakeholders to define requirements. You can use the user flow diagram or the high-level UML diagram to show the work of new features and show how it will apply to your existing system.

### Construction/Iteration:

When the team defines the requirements, the work begins. Designers and developers start working on their project, which aims to deploy a working product. The product will undergo various stages of improvement, so it includes simple, minimal functionality.

### Testing:

In this phase, the Quality Assurance team examines the product's performance and looks for bugs.

### Deployment:

In this phase, the team issues a product for the user's work environment.

### Feedback:

After releasing the product, the last step is feedback. In this, the team receives feedback about the product and works through the feedback.

## Advantages (Pros) of Agile Method:

- Frequent Delivery
- Face-to-Face Communication with clients.
- Efficient design and fulfills the business requirement.
- Anytime changes are acceptable.
- It reduces total development time.

## Disadvantages (Cons) of Agile Model:

- Due to the shortage of formal documents, it creates confusion and crucial decisions taken throughout various phases can be misinterpreted at any time by different team members.
- Due to the lack of proper documentation, once the project completes and the developers allotted to another project, maintenance of the finished project can become a difficulty.`
