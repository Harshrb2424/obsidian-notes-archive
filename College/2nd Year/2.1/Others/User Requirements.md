User requirements serve as a bridge between system developers and end-users who may not possess detailed technical knowledge. It is essential to describe both functional and non-functional requirements in a way that is easily understandable by users. This involves utilizing natural language, tables, and diagrams to ensure clarity for all users.

## Challenges with Natural Language in User Requirements

1. **Lack of Clarity**: Achieving precision without making the document difficult to read can be challenging.
2. **Requirements Confusion**: Functional and non-functional requirements may become intertwined.
3. **Requirements Amalgamation**: Different requirements may be expressed together, leading to confusion.

## Problems in User Requirement Descriptions

1. **Database Requirements**: Combining conceptual and detailed information, such as describing the concept of a financial accounting system in LIBSYS. While the concept is necessary, including unnecessary details like manager configuration at this level is confusing.

2. **Grid Requirement**: Mixing different kinds of requirements, including conceptual functional requirements (the need for a grid), non-functional requirements (grid units), and non-functional UI requirements (grid switching).

## Structured Presentation of User Requirements

### Guidelines for Writing Requirements

1. **Invent a Standard Format**: Establish a standard format and consistently apply it to all requirements.
2. **Use Consistent Language**: Use "shall" for mandatory requirements and "should" for desirable requirements.
3. **Text Highlighting**: Utilize text highlighting to identify key parts of the requirement.
4. **Avoid Computer Jargon**: Ensure the avoidance of computer jargon for better user comprehension.

By following these guidelines, user requirements can be presented in a structured and understandable manner, fostering effective communication between system developers and end-users.
