# Requirements Management
Requirements management is a critical process in the requirements engineering and system development lifecycle. It involves handling changing requirements, which are inherently incomplete and often inconsistent due to evolving business needs and a developing understanding of the system.

## Challenges in Requirements Management

1. **Incomplete and Inconsistent Requirements:**
   - New requirements emerge during the process, and different viewpoints may have conflicting requirements.

2. **Changing Priorities:**
   - The priority of requirements from different perspectives changes during development.

3. **Dynamic Business Environment:**
   - The business and technical environment of the system changes during its development.

# Requirements Evolution

### Enduring and Volatile Requirements

1. **Enduring Requirements:**
   - Stable requirements derived from the core activities of the customer organization.
   - Example: A hospital will always have doctors and nurses.

2. **Volatile Requirements:**
   - Requirements that change during development or system use.
   - Example: Requirements derived from changes in health-care policy.

### Requirements Classification

| Type          | Description |
| ------------- | ----------- |
| Mutable       | Changes due to environmental shifts. |
| Emergent      | Develop during system development. |
| Consequential | Result from the introduction of the computer system. |
| Compatibility | Depend on specific systems or business processes. |

## Requirements Management Planning

During the requirements engineering process, planning includes:

1. **Requirements Identification:**
   - How requirements are individually identified.

2. **Change Management Process:**
   - The process followed when analyzing a requirements change.

3. **Traceability Policies:**
   - Amount of information about requirements relationships maintained.

4. **CASE Tool Support:**
   - Tool support required to manage requirements change.

## Traceability

- **Source Traceability:**
  - Links from requirements to stakeholders who proposed them.
- **Requirements Traceability:**
  - Links between dependent requirements.
- **Design Traceability:**
  - Links from requirements to the design.

## Requirements Change Management

Principal Stages:

1. **Problem Analysis:**
   - Discuss requirements problem and propose change.

2. **Change Analysis and Costing:**
   - Assess effects of change on other requirements.

3. **Change Implementation:**
   - Modify requirements document and other documents to reflect change.

Requirements change management should apply to all proposed changes, and the process involves analyzing, assessing impacts, and implementing modifications to the requirements document.

# System Modeling

System modeling aids analysts in understanding system functionality and communicates effectively with customers. Different models offer various perspectives, such as the behavioral and structural aspects of the system.

## Model Types

1. **Data Processing Model:**
   - Illustrates how data is processed at different stages.

2. **Composition Model:**
   - Shows how entities are composed of other entities.

3. **Architectural Model:**
   - Reveals principal sub-systems.

4. **Classification Model:**
   - Demonstrates how entities share common characteristics.

5. **Stimulus/Response Model:**
   - Depicts the system's reaction to events.

## Context Models

Context models illustrate the operational context of a system, showing what lies outside the system boundaries. Social and organizational considerations may influence decisions regarding system boundaries. Architectural models depict the system and its relationships with other systems.
