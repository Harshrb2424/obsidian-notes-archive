# The Changing Nature of Software

Software engineers face ongoing challenges with the evolution of computer software, which can be broadly categorized into seven main types:

## 1. System Software

- **Definition:**
  - Collection of programs written to service other programs.
  
- **Characteristics:**
  - Heavy interaction with computer hardware.
  - Heavy usage by multiple users.
  - Concurrent operation requiring scheduling, resource sharing, and sophisticated process management.
  - Complex data structures and multiple external interfaces.

- **Examples:**
  - Compilers, editors, and file management utilities.

## 2. Application Software

- **Definition:**
  - Standalone programs solving specific business needs.
  
- **Characteristics:**
  - Facilitates business operations or management/technical decision making.
  - Used to control business functions in real-time.

- **Examples:**
  - Point-of-sale transaction processing, real-time manufacturing process control.

## 3. Engineering/Scientific Software

- **Definition:**
  - Applications ranging from astronomy to volcanology.
  
- **Examples:**
  - Computer-aided design, system simulation, and other interactive applications.

## 4. Embedded Software

- **Definition:**
  - Resides within a product or system, used to implement and control features and functions.
  
- **Examples:**
  - Digital functions in automobiles, dashboard displays, braking systems, etc.

## 5. Product-line Software

- **Definition:**
  - Designed to provide a specific capability for use by many different customers.
  
- **Examples:**
  - Word processing, spreadsheets, computer graphics, multimedia, entertainment, database management, personal and business financial applications.

## 6. Web-Applications

- **Definition:**
  - Evolving into sophisticated computing environments integrated with corporate databases and business applications.

## 7. Artificial Intelligence Software

- **Definition:**
  - Makes use of nonnumerical algorithms to solve complex problems.
  
- **Applications:**
  - Robotics, expert systems, pattern recognition, artificial neural networks, theorem proving, and game playing.

## New Challenges on the Horizon

1. **Ubiquitous Computing:**
   - Develop systems and application software for communication across vast networks involving small devices, personal computers, and enterprise systems.

2. **Netsourcing:**
   - Architect simple and sophisticated applications providing benefits to targeted end-user markets worldwide.

3. **Open Source:**
   - Build self-descriptive source code and develop techniques for customers and developers to track changes within the software.

4. **The "New Economy":**
   - Build applications facilitating mass communication and mass product distribution.
