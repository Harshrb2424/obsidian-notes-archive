#### UNIT I: Computer Organization and Design

- Digital Computers

	- Introduction Computer Basics
		- **Computer**
			- A computer is an electronic device that manipulates information, or data. It has the ability to store, retrieve, and process data. Use a computer to type documents, send email, play games, and browse the Web. You can also use it to edit or create spreadsheets, presentations, and even videos.
		- **Hardware**
			- Hardware is any part of your computer that has a physical structure, such as the keyboard or mouse. It also includes all of the computer's internal parts.
		- **Software**
			- Software is any set of instructions that tells the hardware what to do and how to do it. Examples of software include web browsers, games, and word processors.

	- Definition of **Computer Organization** 
		1. Computer Organization is concerned with the structure and behavior of a computer system as seen by the user.
		2. It deals with the components of a connection in a system.
		3. Computer Organization tells us how exactly all the units in the system are arranged and interconnected.
		4. Whereas Organization expresses the realization of architecture.
		5. Computer Organization deals with low-level design issues..
		6. Organization involves Physical Components (Circuit design, Adders, Signals, Peripherals)

	- Computer Design and Computer Architecture 
		- **Computer Design:**
		  1. Involves hardware development and formulation based on computer specifications.
		  2. Focuses on selecting appropriate hardware components and determining their interconnections.
		  3. Also known as computer implementation, it deals with actual hardware realization.
	
		- **Computer Architecture:**
		  1. Concerned with the user-visible structure and behavior of the computer system.
		  2. Encompasses information formats, instruction sets, and memory addressing techniques.
		  3. Involves designing functional modules like processors and memories, and integrating them into a coherent computer system.

- Register Transfer Language and Microoperations

	- Register Transfer Language 
		- **Register Transfer Language (RTL):**
		  - Symbolic notation describing micro-operation transfers among registers.
		  - Provides organized and concise sequences of micro-operations and control functions.
		  - System for expressing micro-operation sequences within digital modules.
		- **Registers:**
		  - Designated by uppercase letters denoting their function (with optional digits or letters).
		  - Examples: MAR (Memory Address Register), PC (Program Counter), IR (Instruction Register), R1 (Processor Register).
		  - Individual flip-flops in an n-bit register numbered from 0 to n-1.
		  - Representation typically shown in block diagram form.
		  - Rectangular box denotes register name, individual bits distinguished, and bit numbering displayed.
		  - 16-bit register can be divided into low (L) and high (H) bytes.
		  - Example: PC (0-7) or PC (L) for low-order byte, PC (8-15) or PC (H) for high-order byte.
	- Register Transfer, Bus, and Memory Transfers 
		- **Register Transfer:**
		  - Micro-operation transfer between registers expressed symbolically.
		  - Replacement operator denoted as R2 ← R1 signifies content transfer from R1 to R2.
		  - Source register (R1) content remains unchanged post-transfer.
		  - Control condition like if (P=1) then R2 ← R1 dictates transfer under specific control conditions.
		  - Control function (P) generated by control section determines transfer execution.
		- **Basic Symbols of Register Transfer Notation:**
		  - Letters (and numerals) for register designation: MAR, R2.
		  - Parentheses () signify part designation within a register: R2(0-7), R2(L).
		  - Arrow (←) indicates information transfer: R2 ← R1.
		  - Comma (,) separates simultaneous micro-operations: R2 ← R1, R1 ← R2.
		- **Bus and Memory Transfers:**
		  - Common Bus System facilitates efficient multiple-register data transfer.
		  - Constructed using multiplexers or three-state buffers.
		  - Multiplexers select source register, transferring binary information onto the bus.
		  - Three-state buffers enable bus line connection, controlled by binary signals.
		- **Memory Transfer:**
		  - Read operation transfers information from memory word (M) to outside environment.
		  - Write operation stores new information into memory.
		  - Memory word denoted by M, address specified in square brackets: M[AR].
		  - Read operation: DR ← M[AR].
		  - Write operation: M[AR] ← R1 (where R1 holds input data and AR holds the address).
