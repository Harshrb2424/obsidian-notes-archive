# Operating System Services

## Mainframe Systems
- **First Commercial Systems:** Initially, mainframe systems were enormous, expensive, and slow.
- **I/O:** Input and output were handled through punch cards and line printers.
- **User Interaction:** A single operator/programmer/user ran and debugged programs interactively.
- **Standard Library:** Mainframes had a standard library with no resource coordination.
- **Resident Monitor:** The operating system monitor was always resident in memory.
- **Inefficient Hardware Use:** Mainframes suffered from inefficient hardware use, leading to poor throughput and utilization.
- **Batch Systems:** Initially, mainframes executed one program at a time and were known as batch systems.

### Throughput and Utilization
- **Throughput:** The amount of useful work done per hour.
- **Utilization:** The goal of keeping all devices busy to maximize system efficiency.

## Operating System Services
1. **User Interface:**
   - User interface is essential in all operating systems.
   - Users interact with the operating system through a command-line interface (CUI) or graphical user interface (GUI).
   - Command interpreter executes user-specified commands in a CUI.
   - A GUI provides a mouse-based window and menu system for user interaction.

2. **Program Execution:**
   - The OS loads programs into memory and manages their execution.
   - It handles program termination, whether it ends normally or abnormally (indicating an error).

3. **I/O Operations:**
   - Running programs may require input/output operations, involving files or I/O devices.

4. **File-System Manipulation:**
   - The file system is crucial for managing files and directories.
   - It includes file read/write operations, creation/deletion of files and directories, searching, listing file information, and permission management.

5. **Communications:**
   - Processes may exchange information within the same computer or across a network.
   - Communication can occur through shared memory or message passing, where packets are moved by the OS.

6. **Error Detection:**
   - The OS constantly monitors for possible errors in the CPU, memory, I/O devices, and user programs.
   - It takes appropriate actions to ensure correct and consistent computing.
   - Debugging facilities enhance the efficiency of users and programmers.

### OS Functions for Resource Sharing
1. **Resource Allocation:**
   - When multiple users or jobs run concurrently, resources such as CPU cycles, memory, and file storage must be allocated.
   - Some resources may have special allocation code, while others use general request and release mechanisms.

2. **Accounting:**
   - The OS keeps track of resource usage by different users to manage and optimize resource allocation.

3. **Protection and Security:**
   - Protection ensures controlled access to system resources, preventing interference between concurrent processes.
   - Security measures include user authentication and protection against unauthorized access to external I/O devices.
   - Precautions must be instituted throughout the system to maintain protection and security.
