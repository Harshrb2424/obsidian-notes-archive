## 3) Marks in Mathematics
- Marks obtained in Mathematics by 1000 students are normally distributed with a mean of 78% and a standard deviation of 11%. Determine:
    a) How many students got marks above 90%.
    b) What was the highest marks obtained by the lowest 10% of the students.
    c) Within what limits did the middle 90% of the students lie.

## 10) Population Analysis
- A sample of 900 members has a mean of 3.4 cms and a standard deviation of 2.61 cms. Is this sample taken from a large population of mean 3.25 cm and standard deviation 2.61 cms? If the population is normal and its mean is unknown, find the 95% fiducial limits of the true mean.

## 11) Markov Chain
- The transition probability matrix of a Markov chain {Xn} ; n = 1, 2, 3... having three states 1, 2, and 3 is P = (
				0.1 0.5 0.4
				0.6 0.2 0.2
				0.3 0.4 0.3
) and the initial distribution is P(0) = (0.7, 0.2, 0.1). Find:
    a) P{X2 = 3}.
    b) P{X3 = 2, X2 = 3, X1 = 3, X0 = 2}.

## 12) Hypothesis Testing
- Nicotine contents in milligrams in two samples of tobacco were found to be as follows:
    Sample A: 24 27 26 21 25 -
    Sample B: 27 30 28 31 22 36
    Can it be said that the two samples have come from the same normal population?
