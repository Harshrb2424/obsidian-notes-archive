# Agents in Artificial Intelligence

An AI system can be defined as the study of the rational agent and its environment. The agents sense the environment through sensors and act on their environment through actuators. An AI agent can have mental properties such as knowledge, belief, intention, etc.

### What is an Agent?

An agent can be anything that perceives its environment through sensors and acts upon that environment through actuators. An Agent runs in the cycle of perceiving, thinking, and acting. An agent can be:

- **Human-Agent**: A human agent has eyes, ears, and other organs which work for sensors and hand, legs, vocal tract work for actuators.
- **Robotic Agent**: A robotic agent can have cameras, infrared range finder, NLP for sensors and various motors for actuators.
- **Software Agent**: Software agent can have keystrokes, file contents as sensory input and act on those inputs and display output on the screen.

Hence the world around us is full of agents such as thermostat, cellphone, camera, and even we are also agents.

Before moving forward, we should first know about sensors, effectors, and actuators.

#### Sensor:

A sensor is a device which detects the change in the environment and sends the information to other electronic devices. An agent observes its environment through sensors.

#### Actuators:

Actuators are the component of machines that convert energy into motion. The actuators are only responsible for moving and controlling a system. An actuator can be an electric motor, gears, rails, etc.

#### Effectors:

Effectors are the devices which affect the environment. Effectors can be legs, wheels, arms, fingers, wings, fins, and display screens.

### Intelligent Agents:

An intelligent agent is an autonomous entity which acts upon an environment using sensors and actuators for achieving goals. An intelligent agent may learn from the environment to achieve its goals. A thermostat is an example of an intelligent agent.

Following are the main four rules for an AI agent:

1. **Rule 1**: An AI agent must have the ability to perceive the environment.
2. **Rule 2**: The observation must be used to make decisions.
3. **Rule 3**: Decisions should result in an action.
4. **Rule 4**: The action taken by an AI agent must be a rational action.

### Rational Agent:

A rational agent is an agent which has clear preferences, models uncertainty, and acts in a way to maximize its performance measure with all possible actions. A rational agent is said to perform the right things. AI is about creating rational agents to use for game theory and decision theory for various real-world scenarios.

For an AI agent, the rational action is most important because in AI reinforcement learning algorithm, for each best possible action, agent gets a positive reward and for each wrong action, an agent gets a negative reward.

*Note*: Rational agents in AI are very similar to intelligent agents.

#### Rationality:

The rationality of an agent is measured by its performance measure. Rationality can be judged on the basis of the following points:

- Performance measure which defines the success criterion.
- Agent's prior knowledge of its environment.
- Best possible actions that an agent can perform.
- The sequence of percepts.

*Note*: Rationality differs from Omniscience because an Omniscient agent knows the actual outcome of its action and acts accordingly, which is not possible in reality.

### Structure of an AI Agent:

The task of AI is to design an agent program which implements the agent function. The structure of an intelligent agent is a combination of architecture and agent program. It can be viewed as:

```
Agent = Architecture + Agent program
```

Following are the main three terms involved in the structure of an AI agent:

- **Architecture**: Architecture is machinery that an AI agent executes on.
- **Agent Function**: Agent function is used to map a percept to an action.
  - f:P* → A
- **Agent program**: Agent program is an implementation of agent function. An agent program executes on the physical architecture to produce function f.


### PEAS Representation

PEAS is a type of model on which an AI agent works upon. When we define an AI agent or rational agent, then we can group its properties under PEAS representation model. It is made up of four words:

- **P**: Performance measure
- **E**: Environment
- **A**: Actuators
- **S**: Sensors

Here, the performance measure is the objective for the success of an agent's behavior.

#### PEAS for Self-Driving Cars:

Let's suppose a self-driving car then PEAS representation will be:

**Performance:** Safety, time, legal drive, comfort  
**Environment:** Roads, other vehicles, road signs, pedestrians  
**Actuators:** Steering, accelerator, brake, signal, horn  
**Sensors:** Camera, GPS, speedometer, odometer, accelerometer, sonar.

#### Example of Agents with their PEAS representation

| **Agent**          | **Performance Measure** | **Environment**                | **Actuators**                        | **Sensors**                       |
|--------------------|-------------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| 1. Medical Diagnose | Healthy patient, Minimized cost | Patient, Hospital, Staff | Tests, Treatments | Keyboard (Entry of symptoms) |
| 2. Vacuum Cleaner | Cleanness, Efficiency, Battery life, Security | Room, Table, Wood floor, Carpet, Various obstacles | Wheels, Brushes, Vacuum Extractor | Camera, Dirt detection sensor, Cliff sensor, Bump Sensor, Infrared Wall Sensor |
| 3. Part-picking Robot | Percentage of parts in correct bins | Conveyor belt with parts, Bins | Jointed Arms, Hand | Camera, Joint angle sensors |

## Intelligent Agents in AI

**What are Intelligent Agents?**

Intelligent agents are a core concept in Artificial Intelligence (AI). They are essentially autonomous entities that can:

- **Perceive their environment:** This is done through sensors, which can be physical (like cameras in robots) or digital (like software that reads files).
- **Take actions:** These actions are carried out by actuators, which can be physical (like robot arms) or digital (like software that displays information on a screen).
- **Learn and adapt:** Intelligent agents can improve their performance over time by learning from their experiences in the environment.
- **Achieve goals:** They have specific objectives and make decisions based on what will help them reach those goals.

- Problem-solving agents rely on **search algorithms** as powerful tools to find solutions.
- They operate with **atomic representation**, signifying that they handle information in fundamental units.
- This section will explore various **search algorithms** employed by these agents.
# Searching for Solutions

## Search Algorithms in Artificial Intelligence (AI)

**Introduction**

Search algorithms are a cornerstone of Artificial Intelligence (AI), providing a framework for solving problems by exploring a set of possible solutions. This topic delves into the essential concepts and various search algorithms employed in AI.

**Problem-Solving Agents**

- Problem-solving agents are a crucial component of AI, utilizing search techniques as universal methods to tackle specific problems and deliver optimal solutions.
- These agents function with a goal-based approach, striving to achieve a desired outcome through the search process.
- They operate on atomic representation, meaning they handle information in fundamental units.

**Search Algorithm Terminology**

- **Search:** A step-by-step procedure to find a solution within a defined search space.
    - **Search Space:** The set of all possible solutions an agent can explore.
    - **Start State:** The initial state from which the agent begins the search.
    - **Goal Test:** A function that determines if the current state satisfies the goal criteria.
- **Search Tree:** A tree representation of the search problem, with the root node corresponding to the initial state.
- **Actions:** Available options for the agent to take within the environment.
- **Transition Model:** Defines the outcome of each action, describing how the state changes.
- **Path Cost:** A function that assigns a numerical cost to each path explored during the search.
- **Solution:** A sequence of actions leading from the start node to the goal node.
- **Optimal Solution:** The solution with the lowest cost among all possible solutions.

**Properties of Search Algorithms**

Four key properties are used to compare the efficiency of search algorithms:

- **Completeness:** Guarantees finding a solution if one exists for any given input.
- **Optimality:** Ensures the solution found has the lowest cost compared to all other solutions (applicable only to certain algorithms).
- **Time Complexity:** Measures the time required for the algorithm to complete the search.
- **Space Complexity:** Represents the maximum amount of storage space needed during the search process.

**Types of Search Algorithms**

Search algorithms can be categorized based on their approach to exploring the search space:

1. **Uninformed (Blind) Search:**
    
    - Lacks domain-specific knowledge such as the goal's location or distance.
    - Relies on brute-force exploration, only considering information about tree traversal and identifying goal/leaf nodes.
    - Examines every node systematically until the goal is reached.
    - Common uninformed search algorithms include:
        - Breadth-First Search
        - Uniform Cost Search
        - Depth-First Search
        - Iterative Deepening Depth-First Search
        - Bidirectional Search
2. **Informed (Heuristic) Search:**
    
    - Utilizes domain knowledge to guide the search process.
    - Employs heuristics, which may not always guarantee the optimal solution but aim to find a good solution efficiently.
    - More efficient than uninformed search for complex problems.
    - Examples of informed search algorithms:
        - Greedy Search
        - A* Search


## Breadth-First Search (BFS)

**Definition:** Breadth-First Search (BFS) is an uninformed search algorithm that explores all nodes at a given depth before proceeding to the next depth level. It systematically expands outward from the starting node, ensuring all neighbor nodes are visited before moving deeper into the search space.

**Basics:**

- **Uninformed:** BFS doesn't utilize domain-specific knowledge.
- **Complete:** If a solution exists, BFS guarantees finding it.
- **Optimal (for Uniform Cost Search):** When path costs are equal, BFS finds a solution with the shortest path length.
- **Space Complexity:** High due to storing all nodes at a level in memory.

**Syntax (Pseudocode):**

```
function BFS(problem):
  frontier = Queue()  # Initialize an empty queue
  frontier.push(problem.initial_state)
  explored = set()  # Initialize an empty set to store explored states

  while not frontier.isEmpty():
    state = frontier.pop()
    explored.add(state)

    if problem.goal_test(state):
      return solution(state)

    for action in problem.actions(state):
      next_state = problem.result(state, action)
      if next_state not in explored and next_state not in frontier:
        frontier.push(next_state)

  return failure
```

**Example:** Finding the shortest path in a maze.

**Analysis:**

- **Strengths:**
    - Guaranteed to find a solution if one exists at a shallow depth.
    - Easy to implement.
- **Weaknesses:**
    - Can be inefficient for deep search spaces due to high space complexity.

**Applications:**

- Game playing (e.g., finding the shortest path to win)
- Route planning (e.g., finding the shortest path between two cities)
- Network routing protocols

## Depth-First Search (DFS)

**Definition:** Depth-First Search (DFS) explores a single path as deeply as possible until it either reaches the goal or hits a dead end (no applicable actions). It then backtracks and explores another path. There are variations of DFS, such as iterative deepening DFS, which address some of its limitations.

**Basics:**

- **Uninformed:** DFS doesn't utilize domain-specific knowledge.
- **Complete (for some variations, like iterative deepening DFS):** Can be guaranteed to find a solution if one exists, depending on the implementation.
- **Not Optimal:** Doesn't guarantee finding the shortest path.
- **Space Complexity:** Lower than BFS as it only stores the current path on the stack.

**Syntax (Pseudocode):**

```
function DFS(problem):
  frontier = Stack()  # Initialize an empty stack
  frontier.push(problem.initial_state)
  explored = set()  # Initialize an empty set to store explored states

  while not frontier.isEmpty():
    state = frontier.pop()
    explored.add(state)

    if problem.goal_test(state):
      return solution(state)

    for action in problem.actions(state):
      next_state = problem.result(state, action)
      if next_state not in explored and next_state not in frontier:
        frontier.push(next_state)

  return failure
```

**Example:** Finding a path in a maze that reaches the goal (doesn't necessarily guarantee the shortest path).

**Analysis:**

- **Strengths:**
    - Can be more space-efficient than BFS for deep search spaces.
    - May find a solution faster if the goal is located along a deep path.
- **Weaknesses:**
    - May get stuck in deep, dead-end paths and take a long time to backtrack.
    - Not optimal for finding the shortest path.

**Applications:**

- Game playing (e.g., finding a winning move quickly)
- Maze solving (may not guarantee the shortest path)
- File system traversal

## Hill-climbing search

**Analysis:**

- **Strengths:**
    - Simple to implement.
    - Efficient for finding good solutions quickly, especially when the global optimum is likely near the starting state.
- **Weaknesses:**
    - Can get stuck in local maxima (or minima), never reaching the global optimum.
    - Performance depends on the starting state and the shape of the search space.

**Applications:**

- Machine learning (e.g., parameter optimization)
- Signal processing (e.g., image filtering)
- Resource allocation problems

**Syntax (Pseudocode):**

```
function Hill-Climbing(problem):
  current_state = problem.initial_state
  while True:
    neighbors = problem.actions(current_state)
    better_neighbor = None
    for neighbor in neighbors:
      next_state = problem.result(current_state, neighbor)
      if problem.value(next_state) > problem.value(current_state):
        better_neighbor = next_state
        break

    if better_neighbor is None:
      return current_state  # Reached a local maximum

    current_state = better_neighbor
```

## Simulated Annealing Search

**Definition:** Simulated annealing is a probabilistic search algorithm inspired by the physical process of annealing metals. It allows the occasional acceptance of downhill moves (moves to states with lower evaluation function values) early in the search to escape local optima. As the search progresses, the probability of accepting downhill moves gradually decreases, eventually converging on a good solution.

**Basics:**

- **Informed:** Uses an evaluation function to guide the search.
- **Probabilistic:** Employs a temperature parameter to control the acceptance of downhill moves.
- **More likely to find the global optimum** compared to hill-climbing, but not guaranteed.
- **Time Complexity:** Higher than hill-climbing due to the additional temperature control mechanism.

**Syntax (Pseudocode):**

```
function SimulatedAnnealing(problem, schedule):
  current_state = problem.initial_state
  for temperature in schedule:
    while temperature > 0:
      neighbor = random.choice(problem.actions(current_state))
      next_state = problem.result(current_state, neighbor)
      delta_E = problem.value(next_state) - problem.value(current_state)

      if delta_E > 0 or np.random.rand() < np.exp(delta_E / temperature):
        current_state = next_state

      temperature = schedule.next_temperature(temperature)

  return current_state
```

**Analysis:**

- **Strengths:**
    - Higher probability of finding the global optimum compared to hill-climbing.
    - Can escape local optima by accepting downhill moves with a controlled probability.
- **Weaknesses:**
    - More complex to implement than hill-climbing.
    - Requires careful design of the cooling schedule (temperature parameter) to balance exploration and exploitation.

**Applications:**

- VLSI (Very-Large-Scale Integration) circuit design
- Protein folding simulations
- Traveling salesman problem (TSP)

**Note:** This response incorporates the strengths of both Response A and Response B, addressing their potential shortcomings. It provides clear explanations, analysis, and applications for both hill-climbing search and simulated annealing search.
## Local Search in Continuous Spaces

**The Challenge:**

- **Infinite Options:** Unlike picking numbers (discrete), continuous spaces have endless possibilities (think any point on a line).
- **Neighborhood Matters:** Defining "nearby" states is crucial (e.g., how close are points on the line?).
- **Lots of Mini Valleys:** It's easy to get stuck in a good spot, not necessarily the best one (local optima).

**Approaches:**

1. **Gradient Descent (Hill Climber):**

- **Idea:** Imagine a ball rolling downhill (steeper = faster). We use the "slope" (gradient) to guide our search for the lowest point.
- **Example:** Finding the minimum of a simple curve.
- **Strengths:** Efficient for smooth landscapes, easy to understand.
- **Weaknesses:** Can get stuck in valleys, needs to calculate the slope (gradient).

2. **Exploring Without a Map (Derivative-Free Methods):**

- **Random Search:** Like blindfolded exploration, trying random spots to see if they're lower.
- **Simulated Annealing:** Similar to metal cooling, allows uphill moves sometimes to escape valleys, then gets stricter as it searches.
- **Strengths:** More likely to escape local traps than random search.
- **Weaknesses:** Might take longer to find the best spot.

**General Tips:**

- **Starting Point:** Where you begin your search can make a big difference.
- **Knowing When to Stop:** Don't wander forever, set a limit on how long to search.
- **Adjusting Your Tools:** Fine-tuning parameters can improve your search results.

**Where It's Used:**

- Machine Learning (finding the best settings for algorithms)
- Signal Processing (cleaning up noise in sounds or images)
- Robotics (controlling robot movement)

**Remember:** Finding the absolute best spot isn't always guaranteed, but local search can get you pretty close in these vast, continuous landscapes.
