  - 'Place Plate on Table' must occur before 'Place Fork on Table', 'Place Knife on Table', and 'Place Spoon on Table'.
  - The order of placing the fork, knife, and spoon relative to each other is flexible, allowing for parallel execution.

**Benefits:**
- **Efficiency:** Enables more efficient plan execution.
- **Adaptability:** Can adapt to changes or constraints in the environment.

### **1.4 Question:** What is Bayes' theorem? How is it used to update the probability of a hypothesis with new evidence?

**Answer:**

**Bayes' Theorem:**
- **Definition:** A principle in probability theory and statistics that updates the probability of a hypothesis based on new evidence.
- **Formula:**
  $$P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}$$
  - **P(H):** Prior probability of hypothesis H.
  - **P(E):** Probability of evidence E.
  - **P(H|E):** Posterior probability of hypothesis H given evidence E.
  - **P(E|H):** Likelihood of observing evidence E given hypothesis H.

**How Bayes' Theorem is Used to Update Probabilities:**
1. **Start with a Prior Probability:** Initial estimate of the probability of the hypothesis, $P(H)$.
2. **Collect New Evidence:** Gather new data or evidence $E$ relevant to the hypothesis.
3. **Calculate the Likelihood:** Determine the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis, $P(E|H)$.
4. **Compute the Marginal Likelihood:** Calculate $P(E)$, the overall probability of the evidence across all hypotheses.
5. **Apply Bayes' Theorem:** Update the prior probability to the posterior probability $P(H|E)$, reflecting the new belief after considering the evidence.

**Example:**
Suppose a medical test for a disease has the following characteristics:
- **Sensitivity:** 99% (true positive rate), $P(\text{Positive Test}|\text{Disease}) = 0.99$.
- **Specificity:** 95% (true negative rate), $P(\text{Negative Test}|\text{No Disease}) = 0.95$.
- **Prevalence:** 1% of the population has the disease, $P(\text{Disease}) = 0.01$.

You want to find the probability that a person has the disease given a positive test result.

1. **Prior Probability:** $P(\text{Disease}) = 0.01$.
2. **Likelihood:** $P(\text{Positive Test}|\text{Disease}) = 0.99$.
3. **Marginal Likelihood:**
   $$ P(\text{Positive Test}) = P(\text{Positive Test}|\text{Disease}) \cdot P(\text{Disease}) + P(\text{Positive Test}|\text{No Disease}) \cdot P(\text{No Disease})
   $$$$ P(\text{Positive Test}) = 0.99 \cdot 0.01 + 0.05 \cdot 0.99 = 0.0099 + 0.0495 = 0.0594
   $$
4. **Apply Bayes' Theorem:**
   $$ P(\text{Disease}|\text{Positive Test}) = \frac{0.99 \cdot 0.01}{0.0594} \approx 0.167 $$

Therefore, the probability that a person has the disease given a positive test result is approximately 16.7%. This illustrates how Bayes' theorem updates the probability of a hypothesis (having the disease) in light of new evidence (a positive test result).

**Answer:**

**Monte Carlo Method for Approximate Inference:**
- **Definition:** A technique to estimate probabilities by randomly sampling from a probability distribution, useful when exact inference in Bayesian networks is computationally infeasible.

**Steps in the Monte Carlo Method:**
1. **Define the Bayesian Network:** Specify the structure and conditional probability distributions for each node.
2. **Generate Samples:** Randomly generate many samples from the joint probability distribution of the network.
3. **Estimate Probabilities:** Use the generated samples to estimate the desired probabilities or expectations.

**Example: Weather Forecasting**

**Network Structure:**
- **S (Season):** Can be Winter, Spring, Summer, or Fall.
- **W (Weather):** Depends on Season.

**Conditional Probabilities:**
- $P(S = \text{Winter}) = 0.25$
- $P(S = \text{Spring}) = 0.25$
- $P(S = \text{Summer}) = 0.25$
- $P(S = \text{Fall}) = 0.25$
- Given the season:
  - $P(W = \text{Rainy} \mid S)$ varies by season:
    - $P(W = \text{Rainy} \mid S = \text{Winter}) = 0.4$
    - $P(W = \text{Rainy} \mid S = \text{Spring}) = 0.6$
    - $P(W = \text{Rainy} \mid S = \text{Summer}) = 0.2$
    - $P(W = \text{Rainy} \mid S = \text{Fall}) = 0.3$

**Goal:** Estimate the probability of Rainy weather, $P(W = \text{Rainy})$.

**Steps:**
1. **Generate Samples:**
   - Sample the season $S$ according to its prior probabilities.
   - Based on the sampled season $S$, sample the weather $W$ according to the conditional probability $P(W \mid S)$.
2. **Count Samples:**
   - Count the number of samples where $W = \text{Rainy}$.
3. **Estimate Probability:**
   - Estimate $P(W = \text{Rainy})$ as the ratio of the number of samples where $W = \text{Rainy}$ to the total number of samples.

**Example Execution:**
- Generate 10,000 samples.
- Suppose after sampling, 3,000 samples have $W = \text{Rainy}$.

**Calculation:**
$$P(W = \text{Rainy}) \approx \frac{\text{Number of samples where } W = \text{Rainy}}{\text{Total number of samples}} = \frac{3000}{10000} = 0.3$$

Thus, based on Monte Carlo sampling, the estimated probability of Rainy weather is approximately 0.3, or 30%. This method allows us to estimate complex probabilities in Bayesian networks by leveraging random sampling and statistical inference techniques.
