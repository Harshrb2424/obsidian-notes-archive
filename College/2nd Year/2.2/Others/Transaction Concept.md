### Definition
- A transaction is a unit of program execution that accesses and possibly modifies various data items.
- It ensures the ACID properties (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability).

### ACID Properties
- **Atomicity**: Ensures that all operations within the work unit are completed successfully. If not, the transaction is aborted at the point of failure and all previous operations are undone.
- **Consistency**: Ensures that a transaction can only bring the database from one valid state to another, maintaining database invariants.
- **Isolation**: Ensures that the concurrent execution of transactions leaves the database in the same state as if the transactions were executed sequentially.
- **Durability**: Ensures that once a transaction has been committed, it will remain so, even in the event of a system failure.

## Transaction State

### States of a Transaction
1. **Active**: The initial state when the transaction is being executed.
2. **Partially Committed**: After the final statement has been executed, but before the transaction commits.
3. **Failed**: If the transaction cannot proceed to commit due to some failure.
4. **Aborted**: After the transaction has been rolled back and the database is restored to its previous state.
5. **Committed**: After the transaction successfully completes and the changes are permanently applied to the database.

### State Transitions
- **Active to Partially Committed**: After the last operation in the transaction is executed.
- **Partially Committed to Committed**: After successful completion and logging of the transaction.
- **Partially Committed to Failed**: If a failure occurs during the final stages.
- **Failed to Aborted**: Rollback is initiated, and all changes are undone.
- **Active to Failed**: When a failure occurs during transaction execution.

## Implementation of Atomicity and Durability

### Atomicity Implementation
1. **Logging**: Maintain a log of all transaction operations.
   - **Undo Log**: Logs information required to undo changes made by a transaction.
   - **Redo Log**: Logs information required to redo the changes made by a transaction.
2. **Shadow Paging**: Use a shadow copy of the database pages to ensure atomicity.
   - **Shadow Page Table**: A page table pointing to the current state of the database pages.
   - **Commit Operation**: Switch the current page table to the shadow page table.

### Durability Implementation
1. **Write-Ahead Logging (WAL)**: Ensure that logs are written to stable storage before any database changes.
   - **Commit Record**: A record written to the log indicating that a transaction has committed.
2. **Checkpointing**: Periodically save the state of the database to stable storage.
   - **Checkpoint**: A point at which all changes up to that point are guaranteed to be written to stable storage.
   - **Recovery Process**: Use checkpoints and logs to restore the database to a consistent state after a failure.
3. **Stable Storage**: Use of non-volatile storage to maintain durability.
   - **Hardware Solutions**: Use of RAID, SSDs, and other reliable storage technologies.
   - **Software Solutions**: Redundant copies, data replication, and distributed storage systems.

### Recovery Techniques
1. **Immediate Update**: Changes are applied to the database as they occur.
   - **Undo and Redo Operations**: Necessary to maintain consistency during recovery.
2. **Deferred Update**: Changes are only applied after the transaction commits.
   - **Redo Operations**: Only required for committed transactions.

### Transaction Logging Techniques
1. **Physical Logging**: Logs the before and after images of data items.
2. **Logical Logging**: Logs the high-level operations performed by transactions.

### Ensuring Atomicity and Durability in Distributed Systems
1. **Two-Phase Commit Protocol (2PC)**: A protocol to ensure all-or-nothing commitment in distributed transactions.
   - **Prepare Phase**: All participating nodes prepare for the transaction.
   - **Commit Phase**: All nodes commit the transaction if all preparations succeed.
2. **Three-Phase Commit Protocol (3PC)**: An extension of 2PC to avoid blocking in case of a coordinator failure.

### ACID Properties
- **Atomicity**: Ensures that all operations within the work unit are completed successfully. If not, the transaction is aborted at the point of failure and all previous operations are undone.
- **Consistency**: Ensures that a transaction can only bring the database from one valid state to another, maintaining database invariants.
- **Isolation**: Ensures that the concurrent execution of transactions leaves the database in the same state as if the transactions were executed sequentially.
- **Durability**: Ensures that once a transaction has been committed, it will remain so, even in the event of a system failure.

## Concurrent Executions

### Definition
- Concurrent execution of transactions refers to the simultaneous execution of multiple transactions in a multiprogramming environment.

### Advantages
- **Improved Throughput**: Increases the number of transactions processed in a given time.
- **Resource Utilization**: Better utilization of system resources like CPU, memory, and I/O devices.
- **Reduced Waiting Time**: Minimizes the waiting time for transactions.

### Potential Issues
- **Lost Update Problem**: When two transactions simultaneously update the same data item, resulting in one update being lost.
- **Temporary Inconsistency**: When intermediate states of concurrent transactions are visible to other transactions, leading to inconsistency.
- **Uncommitted Data Problem (Dirty Read)**: When a transaction reads data written by another transaction that has not yet committed.
- **Incorrect Summary Problem**: When a transaction computes an aggregate function on data while other transactions are updating it.

## Serializability

### Definition
- Serializability is a concept that ensures the consistency of the database in concurrent execution by ensuring that the outcome of executing transactions concurrently is the same as if the transactions were executed serially.

### Types of Serializability
- **Conflict Serializability**: Ensures that a schedule is conflict-equivalent to some serial schedule. Conflicts arise when transactions have read/write or write/write operations on the same data item.
- **View Serializability**: Ensures that a schedule is view-equivalent to a serial schedule. It is a broader concept than conflict serializability.

### Testing for Serializability
- **Precedence Graph (Serialization Graph)**: A directed graph used to test conflict serializability where nodes represent transactions and edges represent conflicts.

### Schedules
- **Serializable Schedule**: A schedule that is equivalent to a serial schedule.
- **Non-Serializable Schedule**: A schedule that is not equivalent to any serial schedule.

## Recoverability

### Definition
- Recoverability ensures that the database can be restored to a consistent state after a failure, and transactions are rolled back if necessary.

### Types of Schedules
- **Recoverable Schedule**: A schedule where, for each pair of transactions $T_i$ and $T_j$, if $T_j$ reads a data item written by $T_i$, then $T_i$ must commit before $T_j$ commits.
- **Cascadeless Schedule**: A schedule where transactions only read committed data, thus preventing cascading rollbacks.
- **Strict Schedule**: A schedule where a transaction can neither read nor write a data item until the last transaction that wrote that data item has committed.

### Recovery Techniques
1. **Deferred Update (No Undo/Redo)**: Updates are deferred until the transaction commits, simplifying recovery since only redo is required.
2. **Immediate Update**: Updates are applied immediately, requiring both undo and redo operations for recovery.
3. **Checkpointing**: Periodically saving the database state to minimize the work needed during recovery.
4. **Shadow Paging**: Using shadow copies of pages to ensure a consistent state without needing logs for undo.

### Ensuring Recoverability
- **Write-Ahead Logging (WAL)**: Ensuring that all log records are written before the actual data updates are written.
- **Two-Phase Commit Protocol (2PC)**: Ensuring atomicity in distributed systems by coordinating commit/abort decisions among multiple nodes.

## Implementation of Isolation

### Isolation Levels
1. **Read Uncommitted**: Allows dirty reads, where transactions can see uncommitted changes made by other transactions.
2. **Read Committed**: Ensures that transactions only see committed changes, avoiding dirty reads.
3. **Repeatable Read**: Guarantees that transactions see a consistent snapshot of the database, preventing non-repeatable reads.
4. **Serializable**: Ensures the highest level of isolation by preventing phantom reads, where transactions see changes that were made after the transaction started.

### Implementation Techniques
- **Locking**: Use locks to control concurrent access to data items.
- **Multiversion Concurrency Control (MVCC)**: Maintain multiple versions of data items to provide different transactions with consistent views of the database.

## Testing for Serializability

### Conflict Serializability
- **Conflict Operation**: An operation that reads or writes a data item.
- **Conflict Equivalent Schedule**: Two schedules are conflict equivalent if they can be transformed into each other through a series of swaps of non-conflicting operations.

### Precedence Graph (Serialization Graph)
- **Nodes**: Represent transactions.
- **Edges**: Represent conflicts (read-write, write-read, write-write).
- **Testing**: Check if the graph is acyclic; if so, the schedule is conflict serializable.

## Lock-Based Protocols

### Types of Locks
1. **Shared (Read) Lock**: Allows multiple transactions to read a data item simultaneously.
2. **Exclusive (Write) Lock**: Allows only one transaction to write to a data item, blocking all other transactions.

### Lock Granularity
- **Coarse-Grained Locking**: Lock entire tables or large portions of data.
- **Fine-Grained Locking**: Lock individual rows or smaller data units, reducing contention and improving concurrency.

### Locking Protocols
1. **Two-Phase Locking (2PL)**: Ensure strict two-phase locking where locks are acquired before any unlocking begins.
   - **Growing Phase**: Acquire locks.
   - **Shrinking Phase**: Release locks.
2. **Strict Two-Phase Locking (Strict 2PL)**: Release all locks only after the transaction commits or aborts, ensuring no additional locks are acquired.

### Deadlock Handling

- **Active to Failed**: When a failure occurs during transaction execution.

## Timestamp-Based Protocols

### Timestamp Ordering
- Each transaction is assigned a unique timestamp that determines its serialization order.
- **Read Timestamp**: The timestamp when a transaction reads a data item.
- **Write Timestamp**: The timestamp when a transaction writes to a data item.
- **Validation**: Ensures that transactions are serialized according to their timestamps.

### Timestamp-Based Concurrency Control
- **Timestamp-Based Ordering**: Transactions are ordered based on their timestamps to maintain serializability.
- **Timestamp-Based Validation**: Checks if a transaction's read and write timestamps are consistent with other transactions' commit timestamps.

### Timestamp-Based Protocols
1. **Thomas's Write Rule**: A transaction $ T_i $ writes a data item $ X $ only if $ X $ was last written by $ T_i $ or $ T_i $'s timestamp is greater than the timestamp of the last writer of $ X $.
2. **Thomas's Read Rule**: A transaction $ T_i $ reads a data item $ X $ only if $ X $ was last written by $ T_i $ or the last writer of $ X $'s timestamp is less than $ T_i $'s timestamp.

## Validation-Based Protocols

### Definition
- Validation-Based Protocols delay the validation of transactions until they attempt to commit, ensuring that conflicts are detected only when necessary.

### Optimistic Concurrency Control
- **Validation Phase**: Transactions are allowed to proceed without locks or strict ordering.
- **Validation Process**: Check if the transaction's execution would have caused any conflicts if they were executed in a serial manner.

### Validation-Based Protocols
1. **Optimistic Concurrency Control (OCC)**: Assume that conflicts are rare and delay conflict detection until commit time.
   - **Validation Phase**: Transactions are validated before committing.
   - **Conflict Detection**: Check if any other transactions have modified the data read by the transaction during its execution.

## Multiple Granularity

### Granularity Levels
- **Coarse-Granularity Locks**: Lock entire tables or large portions of data.
- **Fine-Granularity Locks**: Lock individual rows or smaller data units, reducing contention and improving concurrency.

### Multiple Granularity Locking
1. **Hierarchical Locking**: Locks are acquired in a hierarchical manner, from higher levels (coarse granularity) to lower levels (fine granularity).
   - **Intent Locks**: Indicate a transaction's intention to lock a higher-level resource, preventing conflicting locks at finer levels.
   - **Shared/Exclusive Locks**: Applied at appropriate levels to balance concurrency and resource contention.

### Benefits of Multiple Granularity
- **Flexibility**: Allows applications to choose appropriate levels of locking based on transaction needs.
- **Performance**: Reduces lock contention and improves concurrency by allowing finer control over locked resources.


### ACID Properties
- **Atomicity**: Ensures that all operations within the work unit are completed successfully. If not, the transaction is aborted at the point of failure and all previous operations are undone.
- **Consistency**: Ensures that a transaction can only bring the database from one valid state to another, maintaining database invariants.
- **Isolation**: Ensures that the concurrent execution of transactions leaves the database in the same state as if the transactions were executed sequentially.

## Recovery and Atomicity

### Importance of Recovery
- **Recovery**: Process of restoring the database to a consistent state after a failure.
- **Atomicity**: Ensures that all operations of a transaction are performed as a single unit. If a transaction fails, all its changes must be undone (rollback).

### Techniques for Achieving Atomicity in Recovery
1. **Write-Ahead Logging (WAL)**: Log records must be written to stable storage before any database modification occurs.
   - **Log Record**: Contains information about operations performed by transactions.
   - **Commit Record**: Indicates that a transaction has successfully committed.
   - **Undo Record**: Allows the system to undo changes made by transactions that are not yet committed.
2. **Shadow Paging**: Maintains a shadow copy of the database, allowing atomicity by committing changes only after all operations are successfully completed.

## Log-Based Recovery

### Log Structure
- **Log**: Sequential file containing records of all transactions.
- **Log Sequence Number (LSN)**: Unique identifier for each log record, used for recovery purposes.

### Recovery Steps
1. **Analysis Phase**: Scan the log to identify transactions that need to be undone (rolled back) or redone (reapplied).
   - **Checkpoint**: Record in the log that marks a consistent state of the database.
2. **Redo Phase**: Reapply changes from the log to ensure durability.
   - **Forward Recovery**: Apply changes that were logged but not yet applied to the database.
3. **Undo Phase**: Rollback transactions that were not committed at the time of failure.
   - **Backward Recovery**: Undo changes made by transactions that were active but not yet committed.

### ARIES (Algorithm for Recovery and Isolation Exploiting Semantics)
- **Logging**: Uses a strict logging protocol to ensure all actions are logged before any changes are made.
- **Recovery Algorithm**: Implements a thorough recovery mechanism comprising Analysis, Redo, and Undo phases to maintain atomicity and durability.

## Recovery with Concurrent Transactions

### Challenges
- **Concurrency Control**: Ensure that concurrent transactions do not interfere with recovery processes.
- **Rollback Dependencies**: Handle dependencies between transactions that require rollback.

### Techniques
1. **Deferred Update**: Delay updates until a transaction commits, simplifying recovery.
   - **Redo Only**: Apply changes that were logged but not yet applied to the database.
2. **Immediate Update**: Apply updates immediately and maintain logs for both redo and undo operations.
   - **Undo and Redo**: Undo transactions that were active and not committed, then redo changes that were logged but not yet applied.

### Handling Concurrent Recovery
- **Locking**: Use locks to prevent concurrent access to data being recovered.
- **Isolation Levels**: Ensure that recovery processes do not interfere with concurrent transactions by maintaining appropriate isolation levels.
