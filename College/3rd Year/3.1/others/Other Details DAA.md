**Prerequisites:**
1. A course on “Computer Programming and Data Structures”.
2. A course on “Advanced Data Structures”.

**Course Objectives:**
- Introduces the notations for analysis of the performance of algorithms and the data structure of disjoint sets.
- Describes major algorithmic techniques and mentions problems for which each technique is appropriate:
  - Divide-and-conquer
  - Backtracking
  - Dynamic programming
  - Greedy methods
  - Branch and bound methods
- Describes how to evaluate and compare different algorithms using worst-, average-, and best-case analysis.
- Explains the difference between tractable and intractable problems, and introduces the problems that are P, NP, and NP-complete.

**Course Outcomes:**
- Analyze the performance of algorithms.
- Choose appropriate data structures and algorithm design methods for a specified application.
- Understand the choice of data structures and algorithm design methods.
