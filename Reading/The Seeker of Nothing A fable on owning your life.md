[The Seeker of Nothing](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/71632207-the-seeker-of-nothing?ref=nav_sb_ss_1_21) by Kabir Munjal is a fictional tale that revolves around the lives of two brothers. Andahar is dealing with inner turmoil and demons that refuse to leave him while his brother Ned-har tries his best to ease his pain and set him free. But nothing seems to work until a day arrives when Ned-har has to fulfil his duties towards his master and it’s only his brother who could do that for him. What has been the haunting past of brothers? How would Andahar’s journey look going forward?

The book takes us to the fabled lands of Corcusia and the Mountains of Templetron. Through Andahar’s journey, where he finds a young boy Elar who eventually treats him as his Master, the book attempts to emphasise the value of self-awareness. It tries to shed light on how one can take charge of their healing and bring themselves peace. An external force could only catalyse the process but the action has to start within.

The writing is simple but pretty thoughtful in the second half. [The first half](https://khyatigautam.wordpress.com/2020/10/20/what-is-the-demand-of-time-arijit-chakraborty-book-review/) is slow as the story is still building up. Come to the second half, and the action begins with numerous nuggets of wisdom coming one’s way. The characters are raw and real, their personalities well-sketched by the author. I certainly liked the complex character of Andahar and how it develops with the narrative’s progression.

I am hugely passionate about the concept of self-growth and the thoughts expressed in this book aligned with my ideas. That clearly made me enjoy reading it. If you are seeking a book for self-help in form of a simple story, you can certainly check this one out.
