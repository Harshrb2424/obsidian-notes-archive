Take a brief look back on your own life to this point. Can you think of a time when a few words of praise have had a hand in shaping the person you've become?

One of the most powerful abilities we have is helping others realize their potential. We can do this by praising their strengths. Yet, this is something we do so infrequently. It's much easier to point out someone's faults. **Even when it's tough to find things to praise, try hard to find something**.

We should also praise often. By noting even small steps and minor improvements, we encourage the other person to keep improving.

> "Praise is like sunlight to the warm human spirit - we cannot flower and grow without it. And yet, while most of us are only too ready to apply to others the cold wind of criticism, we are somehow reluctant to give our fellow the warm praise of sunshine."

We should also be specific in our praise. When praise is specific, it comes across as more sincere, not something we're saying just to make the other person feel good.

## Practice:

If you’re looking to inspire change in a child or employee, write out a list of the milestones he or she will have to hit in order to achieve the ultimate goal. As they hit each milestone, or even as they put in the effort to make progress, offer specific and sincere praise on each gradual step they take.

Help them _feel_ the small successes as they go to keep them motivated.
