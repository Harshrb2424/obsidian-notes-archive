Principle 2:
The only way we can get a person to do anything is by giving them what they want.  ***What do most people want?***

**Health, food, sleep, money, sex.** Most of these wants are usually gratified, but there is one longing, almost as deep and ingrained as the desire for food or sleep, that is seldom gratified: ***the desire to be important.***

> The deepest principle in human nature is the craving to be appreciated.

We tend to take the people in our lives for granted so often that we neglect to let them know that we appreciate them. We must be careful to keep in mind the difference between appreciation and flattery, which seldom works with discerning people, as it is shallow, selfish and insincere.  

***Flattery comes from the tongue; appreciation comes from the heart.***

Day in and day out, we spend most of our time thinking about ourselves. But if we stop thinking about ourselves for a bit and start thinking about other people’s strengths, we wouldn’t have to resort to cheap flattery and we could offer honest, sincere appreciation.  

With words of true appreciation, we have the power to completely change another person’s perception of themselves, improve their motivation, and be a driving force behind their success. When you think about it like that - when we have nothing to lose and only positive outcomes to gain - why _wouldn’t_ we offer genuine appreciation more often?
