Goals are about the results you want to achieve. [Systems](https://jamesclear.com/goals-systems) are about the processes that lead to those results.

If you’re having trouble changing your habits, the problem isn’t you. The problem is your system. Bad habits repeat themselves again and again not because you don’t want to change, but because you have the wrong system for change.

You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems.

Atomic Habits presents a proven system for building good habits and breaking bad ones.
