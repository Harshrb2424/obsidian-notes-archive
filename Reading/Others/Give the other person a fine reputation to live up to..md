Similar to appealing to people’s nobler motives, giving the other person a lofty reputation to live up to incites in them a desire to meet those expectations.

> "If you want to improve a person in a certain aspect, act as though that particular trait were already one of his or her outstanding characteristics."

 Carnegie offers an example of a mechanic named Bill whose work had become unsatisfactory. Instead of berating or threatening Bill, his manager simply called Bill into his office and told him:

_“You are a fine mechanic, you have been in the business for many years, and we’ve had a number of compliments on the good work you have done. But lately, your work has not been up to your own old standards, and I thought you’d want to know since you’ve been such an outstanding mechanic in the past.”_

The result? Bill once again became a fast and thorough mechanic. With the reputation his manager had given him to live up to, how could he not?

## Practice:

When you’re trying to change someone’s mind, give them a reputation to live up to by saying something like:  

_“I respect the fact that you’re always willing to listen and are big enough to change your mind when the facts warrant a change.”_  

Appeal to their nobler motives of responsibility, fairness, openness, diligence, etc.
