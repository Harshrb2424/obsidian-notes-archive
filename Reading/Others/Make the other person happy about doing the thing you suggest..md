The final key to being a leader and changing people without arousing resentment is to make the person happy about doing what we want them to do.

 If you’re having a hard time convincing your child to do a chore, offer to pay her a dollar for every time she does it, and take away a dollar for every time she doesn’t.  

If you choose another internal candidate for the job, tell the one who didn’t get the job that you felt he was too important to the organization in his current role to reassign him.  

If you have an employee who struggles with a certain task, appoint her to be the supervisor for that task, and watch as she improves immediately.  

Offering incentives, praise, and authority are all great ways to make a person happily accept our decisions and do what we want them to do.

## Practice:

To be an effective leader, keep these guidelines in mind when it is necessary to change attitudes or behavior:

**1.** Be sincere. Don’t promise anything you can’t deliver.
**2.** Know exactly what you want the other person to do.
**3.** Be empathetic. Ask yourself what it is the other person really wants.
**4.** Consider the benefits that person will receive from doing what you suggest.
**5.** Match those benefits to the person’s wants.
**6.** When you make your request, put it in a form that will convey to the other person the idea that he personally will benefit.

It is naive to think that by implementing these techniques, we'll always get the outcome we desire. But the experience of most people shows that we are more likely to change attitudes with these approaches than by not using these principles. Even if we increase our success by a mere 10%, we have become 10% more effective as leaders than we were before.  

**With practice, it will become even more natural to apply these principles every day, and soon we will be masters of the art of human relations.**
