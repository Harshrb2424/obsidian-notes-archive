We are often tempted to argue with others, especially when we are absolutely convinced that we’re right about something. But even if we are right, what does arguing about it yield? Why prove someone else wrong? Is that going to make the person like us? Why not just let him save face, if we have nothing to gain from it but “feeling” superior?  

Not to mention, nine times out of 10, **arguing just results in the other person even more firmly convinced that he is right**.  

According to Carnegie, it’s impossible to win an argument. If we lose the argument, we lose; if we win the argument, we have made the other person feel inferior, hurt his pride, and made him resent us. In other words, _we still lose_.

> "There is only one way under high heaven to get the best of an argument - and that is to avoid it."

What if, instead of arguing with someone, we admit their importance through appreciation? This can expand the other person’s ego so he can then become sympathetic and kind.

To keep a disagreement from becoming an argument, we can:

- **Welcome the disagreement.** If the other person is raising a point we haven’t considered, we can be thankful it’s brought to our attention. It may save us from making a mistake.

- **Distrust our first instinctive impression.** Our natural reaction to a disagreeable situation is to become defensive. We should keep calm and watch out for how we first react.

- **Control our temper.** Only negative outcomes result from a bad temper.

- **Listen first.** We can give our opponents a chance to talk without interrupting, and let them finish without resisting, defending, or debating.

- **Look for areas of agreement.** Surface those first.

- **Be honest.** Look for areas where we can admit error and apologize for our mistakes. This helps reduce defensiveness.

- **Promise to think over our opponents’ ideas and study them carefully.** And mean it. Thank our opponents sincerely for their interest. If they’re taking the time to argue with us, they’re interested in the same things we are.

- **Postpone action to give both sides time to think through the problem.** In the meantime, ask ourselves honestly if our opponents might be right, or partly right.

Next time you find yourself in a disagreement with someone, don’t respond with criticism or a negative email. Instead, sleep on it. You’d be surprised how much perspective you can gain by giving yourself a bit of time to think the situation over.
