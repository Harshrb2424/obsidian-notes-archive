 Most people have an innate desire to achieve. Along with that desire often comes a fierce sense of competition - **everyone wants to outdo others and be the best**.  

When nothing else works in winning people to your way of thinking, throw down a challenge.

> "The way to get things done is to stimulate competition. I do not mean in a sordid, money-getting way, but in the desire to excel."


 Frederic Herzberg, one of the great behavioral scientists, did a study of the work attitudes of thousands of people, ranging from factory workers to senior executives. He discovered that the one major factor that motivated people was the work itself. If the work was exciting or interesting, the worker looked forward to doing it.

This is what every successful person loves: the game. We seek a chance for self-expression, a chance to prove our worth, to excel, to win.
