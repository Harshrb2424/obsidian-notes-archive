This section of the Atomic Habits summary presents key points from the actionable strategies in the book, organized around a framework called the Four Laws of Behavior Change.   

The process of building a habit can be divided into four simple steps: cue, craving, response, and reward. 

Breaking it down into these fundamental parts can help us understand what a habit is, how it works, and how to improve it.

The cue triggers a craving, which motivates a response, which provides a reward, which satisfies the craving and, ultimately, becomes associated with the cue. Together, these four steps form a neurological feedback loop—cue, craving, response, reward; cue, craving, response, reward—that ultimately allows you to create automatic habits. This cycle is known as [the habit loop](https://jamesclear.com/three-steps-habit-change).

We can transform these four steps into a practical framework that we can use to design good habits and eliminate bad ones.

The framework is called the Four Laws of Behavior Change, and it provides a simple set of rules for creating good habits and breaking bad ones.
