## Practice:

Next time you find yourself becoming frustrated or disagreeing with another person’s perspective, stop yourself from shaking your head, and adjust how you phrase your opinion:

	  “No, you’re wrong.”
	✓  “Why do you see it that way?”
	   “No, that’s the wrong way to tackle.”
	✓  “Why do you think that’s the best option to pursue?”

You might even ask the other person for permission to share your perspective on the matter, which readies the other person to listen to your ideas in a less critical mindset.
