## 7 Ways to make conversation with Anyone

- The first work flood gates: Just say it
- Skip the small talk: Ask a really personal question
	- Interesting name. How did your parents think of it? Is there a story behind it?
	- How long have you lived in this city?
	- Where did you come from? Where did your family live?
- Find the Me too
- Pay a unique genuine complement
- Ask for an opinion
- Be present, Make eye contact
- Name, place, animal, thing

## How to have a good conversation
- Don‚Äôt be half in half out of the conversation. Be in it or out of it.
- Don‚Äôt pontificate. Stating an opinion without the opportunity for response, argument or discussion. Enter every conversation assuming that you have something to learn. Set aside your personal opinion. Everyone you meet knows something that you don‚Äôt. Everyone's an expert in something.¬†
- Who, what, where, when, how? Let them describe it. (Use open-ended questions)
- Go with the flow. Thoughts will come and go.¬†
- If you don‚Äôt know, say that you don‚Äôt know. Talk should not be cheap.¬†
- Don‚Äôt equate your experience with theirs. If they‚Äôre talking about the time they lost a family member, don‚Äôt start talking about the time you lost a family member. If they start talking about the trouble they‚Äôre having at work, don‚Äôt start talking about how you hate your job. It‚Äôs never the same. All experiences are individual.¬†
- Try not to repeat yourself. It can come across as condescending and it‚Äôs really boring. We tend to do it a lot in work situations and conversations with our kids.¬†
- ¬†Stay out of the weeds. People don‚Äôt care about the minutiae. What they care about is you.¬†
- Listen. This is the most important.¬†
	- If your mouth is open you‚Äôre not learning ‚Äì Budda and every Dad there ever was.
	- No man ever listened his way out of a job ‚Äì Calvin Coolidge.
- Be brief.¬†
	- A good conversation is like a mini skirt; short enough to maintain interest, but long enough to cover the subject.
- Be interested in other people.
- Everyone has some hidden amazing thing about them.
- Go out, talk to people and prepare to be amazed.

# The Story
The quite girl, doesn't bother anyone. she comes with one of bus mates who is in other section. talking, laughing together in the mornings.
The only person i can relate her is Netra Arsid from my school (charismatic, beautiful and well mannered).
Never got a proper opportunity to talk to each other; that's how low profile she is.
During English Lab: coincidently we were in the same group and did the task: Conversation between 2 people together. During the conversation: She was my elder sister going abroad and i was asking her suggestions.
During the next lab sessions once I got to sit beside her. One of the other boys from my class was also keen to talk to her and wanted to sit beside her, somehow it didn't happen. At the back of my note books there where cross word puzzles which she solved on that day.
Later occasionally i would give have printouts of few random cross word puzzles and greet her in the mornings.
During the release of Avatar: The Way of Water I saw her coming out of the theater while i was going in. such a strange thing to happen. She was with one of her friend going home.
In January, classmates decided to go to a mall. she lives closest to my home so it felt my responsibility to try come along. She was sleeping at her friends home and I was waiting for her arrival in ECIL. I almost gave up and was in bus to the mall but the decided to go back and wait for her in Tarnaka. She finally came barley conscious, went to mall in the crowd of metro holding hands. Had fun time out there and came back in metro she sleeping on my shoulders till Tarnaka.
One of my friends who came with to the mall liked her. (Which is not what i intended to happen. i though he would like her friend) while he hoped to get closer to her, I was collaborating with her and doing Presentations in the class. One of the days in my laptop she was the questions i asked ChatGPT such as "What is Love?". 
In the evening, she used to play a little football with is in the ground. He (other boy from my class) was still vagally trying to ask if the was interested and can talk to her. She wasn't and she made that clear. He didn't stop, he messages, gets blocked, uses other phone number...
I was most delighted when she gave a chocolate after the presentation before i want home half day to go to family trip. On the same night he messaged (the friend who came with to the mall and likes her) asking if it was fine for him to ask her out to go to cafe planning to propose her. and if i liked her too...
I do like her but we're just friends and I said to go for it.
*According to her....*
	She, her sister and he met in cafe had a talk and went home.
*According to him....*
	He went to his home, had a little chat with her mom. She, her sister and he went to cafe. He would have proposed if her sister was not there at that moment. He decided to say to her on Valentine's day. 
Later on they used to chat a lot and talk together till her bus stop. One of the days while wallking he did give hints and maybe show knew that he liked her.... but after few it all ended. 
*Why?* 
	she never told me but she has regrets from her side for the mistakes she has done. 
	He was frustrated because she stopped giving the attention she used to give and what he deserved. He was mentally fucked and decided to move away and only contacting for college related things.

While all of thing was going on, I used to message her while I was going to Abits (used to do part time job there) about life, its sufferings and share each others sufferings.
Some times I used to sit in the empty bench in front of her bench and discuss about math (generally or other academic things) with her and her friends sitting beside her. I hoped to get a good enough reason to go there and talk to them.
During the first semester exams we had little talks when time permits. And I just decided to help her out academically till the end. (I'll do too much for her own good)
Later on, It transitioned to doing Math home work together and studying together. I used to prepare a little before calling her to explain her properly. i hoped it could continue till the end of the college life. *like what can possibly stop it from happening huh.* According to the calls we were in, she was as busy as in present, she used to have the courage and power to turn them down and allocate some time.
She loves her dog but doesn't the love back. She is a excellent reader which all started from Harry Potter but later moved to fanfiction and BL. I wished she writes her own books, especially her auto biography. She watches Anime, Series: BL, reads Manga, story Books (extreme genera). 
Used to spend time in library, class listening few of the story books she has read. Even i tried to say a book. May be she didn't like it according to her disinterest while listening and not continuing of this any more.
Her attendance were always less than required, still am improvement from 1st semester. She honestly has no reason to come to college. I tried to find her a good reason but failed.
Once we both decided to go in college together at noon for lab exam. I picked her up in scotty and went together. she was navigating me.
Once only we both where in class writing some notes sitting in one bench and BEE sir entered asking contact info of a classmate. I went and gave it to him. While coming back the sweet smile of her trying to hide emotions and trying to be calm and asking what will sir think after only seeing only us in the class? Such experiences which i never thought i would experience.
Decided to study together in person and set a time. I am prepared to reach on time with no errors i started from home. she asked to come 1hr later so I was waiting in ECIL. in the mean time i met a school friend there and he drop me on time. Ya Sundays generally start late, so could have planned it according na. Me talking to her parents, She brings breakfast and her friend. We study together math, taught her friend EG and helped in drawings. It was a long day. but she was angry because i told her friend she's lazy and doesn't do much in class. Which i got to know later on and Apologized and wont repeat it again. That is way I was so hesitant to speat at all to any of ur friends during video calls scared of the consequences.
Occasionally when her class bus friend hadn't attended the college, i got the opportunity to walk with her till the bus. at which place an argument happened for what I had said to her friend and what had changed in communicating after that day.
During a rainy day, she called and asked to come with an umbrella to her at MRITS. Its a small thing but I excitement i had to do so was immersible. Then we came back together.
We both decided to go watch a movie (Oppenheimer) in Sunday. I don't know what was in her mind, completely in other world. Ya the movie wasn't an entertaining one i know that. At the end of the movies she met one of her school jr. and talked a little. the thing which bugged me was saying saying ‚ÄúI was her classmates‚Äú which is not wrong but I expected to call me as a ‚ÄúFriend‚Äú. I hoped to ask her also watch another movie (barbie) which would be entertaining but that didn't happen.
I wish she had invited in few of the hangout she did with class friends.
The occasional discussions we had of dream houses, countries to visit.
The 1.2 semester exams: we weren't talking much at this time and i was hoping to convenes her to travel together in scotty but i wasn't even able to talk to her casually. She was busy in her own world completely felling unknown. Travelling alone for more than an hour no one knows the thoughts which arrive at such times. 
Thought to still give one more try but this time i couldn't even find her anywhere.  I gave up this impossible task: to give which was never asked for.
But then on the 3rd day when i dint come in scotty, she remembers my existence... (the worst case happened)
The last exam EG was afternoon, bus students came in the morning and we discased really well. In all the teaching especially to her, i became really good in it. She is the sole reason i got full marks in EG.
When the results came, i shared with her and had a little discussion. everything was good.

2nd year: at beginning she attended to college daily event though not many class were happening, she started discussing about writing reviews, wany to monetarize her literature. Last semester she aimed to do a small sketch everyday. Don't know what happened to it. 
One of the main reasons I decided to take college bus is to get a little more time to talk to her. It was worth every penny.
I did do an say a lot of stupid things this semester. Most weren't too big to cause any issues until i once said about cooking. It got soo out of hand. After talking to One of her friends (batchmate) it was resolved. Such thing happened once before too (I don't remember when exactly), I was so furious at her self centered behavior I was gonna deleted her contacts and unfollow from social media but thankfully my friend stopped while we were sitting beside the MRITS ground. 
Apart from the topics for which where where conflicts, the main reason it happened when after having a good intentions is the was i communicated it to her. Which is true. At the few times when I traveled along her in bus, the discussions which happened about her smile, politics, feminism and complete discussion about her family. All of these discussions without saying anything controversial. Isn't this a sign of improvement ?
For her birthday, I lent her 2 books which my sister had. Later decided to also give her few of the physical photo printouts. I hope we had taken a good photo together. The primary purpose was to only take printouts for her, since my friend was angry on me, I had to get few for him and his friends.
On my birthday which was on a holiday, Its a 100 times better to get few wishes from the people u care than from people who just got to know of it via social media. Same old location I've been going for years on my birthday, but this time there was you few kilometers away. I was such a stupid thing to go to her home give her a cake on my birthday but was worth it just to see her.
Once after a little quarrelling she had asked "what would happen if we would date" i had the nasty answer to say "there is only one way to find out (which was to try)" i thought honestly it'll stay the same. But she thinks it would be a complete chaos.
Once she had also told this but I like assume she wasn't concisions while saying this that "She would marry me if i had a fortune". It gave such a mixed felling of being someone who could be chosen, But also the one who is chosen only for my external things. Being me isn't enough for anyone in this world.
small talks about how good moon looked, the rainy beautiful weather.
Once we went home at noon in auto, talking the whole time.
As the exams where approaching I used to ask about her preparations and her replies started to become dry, delayed. I had stopped asking or the reasons foe being absent instead I would send her notes and say about what happened in the classes. This isn't ideal which it was the only thing in my hands, I was already prepared to simply pay her condonation fees to if it came to it. (I didn't day for the condonation and the money went to fast food in canteen for Me and my bus friend for a week, 2 events).
I used to help her in paying the exam fees every semester. Once she needed to do a project in github, the time was less, she was busy and barely interested when we talked about it.
There is a plan to visit her home along with her friend (batchmate) and surprise her along with donuts (coz her sister likes it).
This year she wanted to read self-help books and I recommended to her have the resources. And I don't think she has read any....
New Year
The duo which used to study and do homework together vanished. Cant do much, things change i know that so I wanna know is the new person doing regarding it. Asking this only gave vague answers. I did provide with all the resources possible. I this process to feel free to ask for any doutes. This made her angry and i had no idea. She would have gotten doutes if she had studied I was i thinking so i asked her again the same thing which made her angry last time. I got to know she was furies at that time. After the exam, we talked in the bus, then text, and more text and it got excecated to chaos. Since the final exams where so close I just left the things where they where so both us could study without any issues.
Seeing her in the bus, exam center always caused heart to beat faster and it becomes heavy. I didn't wanted to bring my sooty at all after what had happened last semester, But the anxiety of bus reaching the center late and the chaos of travelling home in RTC i had to bring scotty. Honestly it want as bad as i had expected with the company even if it wasn't her.

2.2: 
The academic resources i send her made her disrespectful, going to her in the bus would be chaos to talk to her. Went thanks to a little motivation from my new friend: she was still furies and resentful. barely trying to answer. And there I was happy to be able to see her directly without felling heavy. She insisted to fix what had happened to continue. At that state: trying to speak up, fix things, not heart you, not look like a idiot, act cool and calm myself, not get angry about the things u have told. What could i possibly do.
Day after tomorrow, U didn't come to college..., shaking i called her had thinking about it more than the call lasted. She finally opened and said about every grudge she had on me which was good but then it didn't have much for me to say to her than just reassurance. I have a million things at the start but non now.
Next time i wanted to meet, I missed by bus and thought about going in her bus... but her anger when i wanted ask a question was crazy. Since then I'm too scared to confront her and she is not gonna initiate any type of conversation anyways. Avoidance is easier than confrontation even to me.........
Later once I and he (You Know Who) met and told everything which had happened. At first we where cussing at each other in the restaurant later on according to him "Neither you nor she has changed at all"
Even talked to her batchmate and she has no idea to resolve it.
She has only discussed it with only one person in the class according to my friend. I asked the friend and the issue is the way I communicate, giving too much, asking her too much to study is irritating, there aren't many topics to talk about. Honestly we have nothing in common.
