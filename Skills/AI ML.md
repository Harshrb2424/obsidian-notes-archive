# Generative AI on Edge
AI
- to provide service to users.

 GenAI
 - Customer have the power.
 - They can create their own custom services by their own.
 
Gen 3 CPUs can give Text and Image outputs, video editing tools.

AI On Drive: 
Mobile: helps in productive improvements
Automobile: custom navigations while travelling
Contextual Personalization. (currently it uses random seed values. should be changed to personalization.)

Key Challenges
- Model Size
	- Efficiency
- Memory Bandwidth
	- Parallel Processing
- Compute
	- Processing Speed
- Power
- Personalization Cost
	- No. of Floating points

to make it possible locally
- it compresses the info
	- eg: image is reduces to 4 or 2 bit images.

Hybrid AI
- either locally or in cloud
	- based in Model Size
- combine both locally and cloud

Speculative decoding
Qualcomm: have custom accelerators

AI Stack C++, python
1 code run anywhere.

Benefits
- Privacy
- cost
- Performance
- Energy
- Personalization

FPGA


# Unlocking AI Potential with Memory and Storage
Number of paraments in AI are expanding exponentially so is Memory requirement.

It takes more time to load the model in the device than to render/ process the tokens/prompts.

### Memory
Currently: DDR5X
in early future: DDR6

## Why ?
Productivity
Creativity
Personalization

## Smart Manufacturing
- Mechanized Production
- Mass production
- Automation
- Automation
- Informative
- Human-Machine Convergence


# Machine Learning

### Machine Learning Framework

- unknown Target Function (ideal function)
- Target Examples
- Hypothesis
	- All 3 are processed to learning algorithm
		- Final hypothesis (final function)
Eg: bank checking credit score for lending loan.

a tasks needs to be divided into subtasks for performance.

finding floating point (variables which computer and process) take more than 50% of the project.

Study if algorithms that
- improves their **performance** 
- at some **task**
- with **experience**

1. the **performance** needs to be > 80%
2. **task:** what to actually do
3. **experience** data sample, database.

training data (input and output are given to learn)
test data (outputs are unknown for it)

#### Frameworks
data driven
model driven

#### Deep learning
machine learning happening multiple times in a way
